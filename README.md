# sallonoroff.github.io

Hello! I'm in the process of moving my blog (sallonoroff.co.uk) from WP to Jekyll on GitHub Pages. This site is largely based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) but has had numerous modifications, hacks and bodges applied.  
  
Here's a list of pages that have helped along the way.
