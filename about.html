	<p>The dollops of poorly-written text you'll find on this weblog are based on thoughts originally formulated inside the head of Mark Wainwright. Let's pretend that the best stuff is lost in translation.</p>
	<p>Mark is thirty-something, an incapable perfectionist and has inclinations toward idleness, over-eating, pedantry and self-deprecating humour. And clearly he's the sort of idiot that thinks somebody might care what he has to say about computers, gadgets, technology, science, the web and lots of other stuff.</p>
