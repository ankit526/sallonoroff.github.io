	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Thanks for coming. This is the personal website of Mark Wainwright. Typically it's used to record half-baked thoughts about things made with ones and noughts. Please try <a href="/blog">the blog</a> for the latest examples. Otherwise, have a look through the archive of blog posts by either <a href="/blog/archive">date</a> or <a href="/blog/tags">tag</a>. You can also find out a little more <a href="/about">about Mark</a>, if you really want to.</p>
