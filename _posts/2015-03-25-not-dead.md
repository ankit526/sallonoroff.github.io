Hello website visitor. Hello person whose RSS reader I&#8217;ve just turned up in.

I noticed that it has been nearly a year since my last post here and I felt I should write something to avoid it actually reaching a whole 12 months of neglect. I do keep thinking of things to write about &#8211; and there are plenty of hurriedly jotted words, sentences and links sat in the WordPress Drafts folder that are testament to this &#8211; but never get around to turning them into something suitable for public consumption. I won&#8217;t make any rash promises about updating this thing more regularly but I am going to _try_ to go through some of the half-baked drafts and see if anything is worth posting.

Thanks for reading.
