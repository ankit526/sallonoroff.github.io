Hmm&#8230; Seems everybody is copying the same design. I'm not sure what that is though. I just can't put my finger on it&#8230;

OH! Hang on, that's it&#8230;

The iPhone

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, i suppose. Fingers-crossed that Apple spoils everyone's copycatting by foregoing the iPhone-look and introducing a brand new industrial design for their tablet offering.
