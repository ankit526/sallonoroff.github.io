I&#8217;ve just discovered [Aviary](http://aviary.com) following their Technical Achievement award win at the [SXSW &#8217;09 Web Awards](http://sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/finalists).

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-370" title="aviary-unzipped-kitty" src="/images/fromwp/2009/03/aviary-unzipped-kitty.jpg" alt="aviary-unzipped-kitty" width="240" height="178" />At present the site [offers](http://aviary.com/tools) free online image editing, vector editing, a &#8220;visual laboratory&#8221; and colour palette generator but they&#8217;re planning on video editing, audio editing, font creation, 3D modelling, desktop publishing and more. I&#8217;ve not had much chance to play yet but it seems like very, very impressive stuff from what i have seen.

Definitely one to watch.
