[RegHardware review the updated entry-level MacBook](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/02/12/review_laptop_apple_macbook_white/), offering the final judgement:

> _&#8220;In fact, in terms of all-round value for money the new white MacBook might actually be the best buy in the entire Mac range at the moment. So if youâ€™re thinking about upgrading an old Mac, or switching from a PC for the first time, the new white MacBook is almost certainly the best place to start.&#8221;_

Until the iMac and Mac Mini are updated, [I would tend to agree](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/01/white/)._
