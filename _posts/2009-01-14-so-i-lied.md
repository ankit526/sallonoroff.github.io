&#8230;my first-ever post wasn&#8217;t my last-ever post.

My current thinking is that i&#8217;ll use this weblog for ranting about techie things. Things that aggrevate or excite me, that amuse or bemuse me. In short, it&#8217;ll probably be boring as hell. Much like every other blog on t&#8217; web then i suppose.
