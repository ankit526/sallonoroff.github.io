With the wonders of ever-shrinking technology, i wondered how long it would be untilÂ [this would happen](https://www.sonystyle.co.uk/SonyStyle/MP3-WALKMAN/Wearable-Walkman/NWZW202B.CE7):

A big dollop of kudos to Sony for being (as far as i'm aware) the first to market with these MP3-player-in-the-headphones devices. Shame they're quite ugly. And cost 60 quid for just 2gb storage.
