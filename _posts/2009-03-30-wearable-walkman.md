With the wonders of ever-shrinking technology, i wondered how long it would be until [this would happen](https://www.sonystyle.co.uk/SonyStyle/MP3-WALKMAN/Wearable-Walkman/NWZW202B.CE7):

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" title="sony-nwzw202bce7" src="/images/fromwp/2009/03/sony-nwzw202bce7.jpg" alt="sony-nwzw202bce7" width="323" height="246" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/03/sony-nwzw202bce7.jpg 323w, /images/fromwp/2009/03/sony-nwzw202bce7-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" />Big dollop  of kudos to Sony for being (as far as i&#8217;m aware) the first to market with these MP3-player-in-the-headphones devices. Shame they&#8217;re quite ugly. And cost 60 quid for just 2gb storage.
