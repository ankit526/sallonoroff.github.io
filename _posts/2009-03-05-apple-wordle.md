Been messing aroung with [wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net/) a lot lately. I find myself quite fascinated by it and i can&#8217;t seem to stop hitting the &#8220;Randomize&#8221; button to see what&#8217;ll happen to the &#8220;word cloud&#8221; next. Here&#8217;s the [Apple press release](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/03/03consumer.html) about the new desktop line-up put through Wordle:

<div id="attachment_308" style="width: 492px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="/images/fromwp/2009/03/apple-wordle2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-308" title="apple-wordle2" src="/images/fromwp/2009/03/apple-wordle2.jpg" alt="apple-wordle2" width="482" height="322" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/03/apple-wordle2.jpg 1235w, /images/fromwp/2009/03/apple-wordle2-300x201.jpg 300w, /images/fromwp/2009/03/apple-wordle2-1024x686.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Clearly there&#8217;s no surprises in what words feature most prominently. It&#8217;s just a shame that Wordle doesn&#8217;t count &#8220;Â®&#8221; as a word &#8211; with an Apple press release i&#8217;m sure that symbol &#8216;d be the biggest thing by a mile.
