I've been messing aroung with [Wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net/) a lot lately. I find myself quite fascinated by it and i can't seem to stop hitting the &#8220;Randomize&#8221; button to see what'll happen to the &#8220;word cloud&#8221; next. Here's the [Apple press release](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/03/03consumer.html) about the new desktop line-up put through Wordle:

Clearly there's no surprises in what words feature most prominently. It's just a shame that Wordle.net doesn't count &#8220;Â®&#8221; as a word &#8211; with an Apple press release i'm sure that symbol would be the biggest thing by a mile.
