[Apple today revealed](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/02/16Apple-Releases-OS-X-Mountain-Lion-Developer-Preview-with-Over-100-New-Features.html) that the next version of OS X will be [Mountain Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/). It&#8217;ll be released in &#8220;late summer&#8221; and it seems to very much continue the iOS-ification of the Mac operating system.

Amongst the 100+ new features will be Messages (re-branded iChat, with iMessage capability), Reminders (a standalone app, no longer part of iCal), Notes (a standalone app, no longer part of Mail), Notification Center, Game Center and AirPlay Mirroring.

Take a look at [Macworld&#8217;s Hands-On](http://www.macworld.com/article/165407/2012/02/hands_on_with_apples_new_os_x_mountain_lion.html) for more in-depth coverage.

Oh, and be sure to have a read of [Gruber&#8217;s post](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/mountain_lion) detailing how Apple treated him (and presumably other influential journos and bloggers) to a &#8220;press event for one&#8221;.
