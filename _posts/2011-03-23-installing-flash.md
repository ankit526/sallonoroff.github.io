Something i find myself doing, more often than i&#8217;d like, is installing or updating [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/) on Windows PCs. It isn&#8217;t very difficult but it is a much more long-winded process than it needs to be, often resulting in Adobe wanting you to install their &#8220;Download Manager&#8221; in order to download the Flash Player. In short, the hoops you&#8217;re made to jump through by usingÂ <http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/> are very annoying.

You can download the &#8220;manual&#8221; installers directly from Adobe&#8217;s site but they keep them well buried and i often forget the steps necessary to find them. But no more! If, like me, you just want the installer .exe files (yes, plural &#8211; there&#8217;s one version for Internet Explorer and another for all other browsers) you can get them from here:

[[http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/191/tn\_19166.html#main\_ManualInstaller](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/191/tn_19166.html#main_ManualInstaller)](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/)

Or, for those that prefer something a little more memorable:

You&#8217;re welcome.
