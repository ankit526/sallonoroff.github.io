No time for dilly-dallying here, i&#8217;m just going to come out and say it&#8230; Wouldn&#8217;t it be cute if Nestlé stuck a thumb on the Kit-Kat? Who wouldn&#8217;t love to eat a Kit-Kat Hand**™**?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" title="The Kit-Kat Hand" src="/images/fromwp/2011/05/kk-hand.jpg" alt="The Kit-Kat Hand" width="560" height="560" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/05/kk-hand.jpg 560w, /images/fromwp/2011/05/kk-hand-150x150.jpg 150w, /images/fromwp/2011/05/kk-hand-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />

Not bad, eh? But you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll never get made. Think of the special packaging required!&#8221; Yeah, well that&#8217;s easily overcome &#8211; package them in twos! The Kit-Kat Handshake**™**!

&#8220;Oh, but then that&#8217;ll be too much chocolate! Too many calories! Too much fat!&#8221; you say. Easily overcome i reply &#8211; You market it as a pack to be shared. Hell, the &#8220;handshake&#8221; thing even lends itself to that. So, healthy people can share a treat and fatties like me (who think nothing of eating two 4-finger Kit-Kats anyway) can scoff all 9 fingers to themselves. Win-Win.

The ball is in your court, Nestlé.

PS. Nestlé bods, if you do make this, how about sending a little reward my way? 1% of the profits on the Handshake**™**? Life-time supply of them? Something like that&#8217;d be awfully nice. Ta.
