No time for dilly-dallying here, i'm just going to come out and say it&#8230; Wouldn't it be cute if Nestlé stuck a thumb on the Kit-Kat? Who wouldn't love to eat a Kit-Kat Hand&trade;?

Not bad, eh? But you're thinking &#8220;Oh, it'll never get made. Think of the special packaging required!&#8221; Yeah, well that's easily overcome &#8211; package them in twos! The Kit-Kat Handshake&trade;!

&#8220;Oh, but then that'll be too much chocolate! Too many calories! Too much fat!&#8221; you say. Easily overcome i reply &#8211; You market it as a pack to be shared. Hell, the &#8220;handshake&#8221; thing even lends itself to that. So, healthy people can share a treat and fatties like me (who think nothing of eating two 4-finger Kit-Kats anyway) can scoff all 9 fingers to themselves. Win-Win.

The ball is in your court, Nestlé.

**PS.** Nestlé bods, if you do make this, how about sending a little reward my way? 1% of the profits on the Handshake&trade;? Life-time supply of them? Something like that'd be awfully nice. Ta.
