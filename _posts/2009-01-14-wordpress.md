This blog is created with WordPress. I don&#8217;t know if that is a good thing or not. My blog choice was simply down to the software available from my hosts. It seems to be quite straight-forward to use&#8230; and, having had a fumble around today, fairly easy to administer.

I&#8217;ve just upgraded the install to version 2.7 and that was a fairly painless experience (though, i suppose i had nothing on here for it to go wrong). Adding a new theme (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplex" target="_blank">Simplex</a>) was simple and i&#8217;ve even managed to hack it a little so that the page header matches my &#8220;<a href="http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/" target="_blank">homepage</a>&#8221; style. I just edited _/simplex/style.css_ and _/simplex/css/default.css_ to make the changes (Apologies to Simplex author <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/profile/nhuja" target="_blank">nhuja</a> if i&#8217;m not meant to bugger about with your work &#8211; sorry! &#8211; but i&#8217;m new to this game and it&#8217;s not like i&#8217;m claiming the design is my own).

My only grievance with wordpress so far is that the blog date entries are showing in full written date format even though i&#8217;ve chosen dd/mm/yyyy in the Settings. Odd.

Edit: A second grievance&#8230; there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a way to turn-off the &#8220;Meta&#8221; links in the sidebar. Oh well, some more hacking will get rid of that hopefully.
