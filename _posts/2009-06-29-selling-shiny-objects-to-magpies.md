I&#8217;ve neglected Zero Punctuation lately but have just indulged in a mass catch-up. Last week&#8217;s &#8220;[E3 Hype Massacre](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/779-The-Second-Annual-E3-Hype-Massacre)&#8221; is well worth a watch, if only for Yahtzee&#8217;s take on Microsoft&#8217;s fancy Project Natal (and indeed, all motion controller systems).
