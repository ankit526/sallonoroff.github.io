You&#8217;d have thought connecting the plug to a modern, consumer product like a [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/) table wouldn&#8217;t even require thinking about, right? Wrong. Apparently it takes 30 minutes, requires 4 people and a call to one of MS&#8217; helpdesks. [Click here](http://kinesismomentum.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/skin-deep-usability/) for the marvellous tale of setting up one of Microsoft&#8217;s hot new toys.

**Update (25/04/09):** [Gruber points out](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/24/microsoft-surface) that the original blog entry has been removed by its author, Gordon Miller, so if you want to read it you&#8217;ll now need to [use google](http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:slfEjqHmIyoJ:kinesismomentum.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/skin-deep-usability/+http://kinesismomentum.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/skin-deep-usability/).
