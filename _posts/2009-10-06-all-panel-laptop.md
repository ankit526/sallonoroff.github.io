Well blow me down with a feather, it seems my &#8220;[MacBook DS](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/shiny-new-apple-products/)&#8221; idea isn&#8217;t original. Sony has [recently](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/06/video-sonys-ceatec-concept-party-includes-walkman-bracelet-and/)* been showing off its beautiful &#8220;all-panel laptop&#8221; concept&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" title="sony-allpanel-concept" src="/images/fromwp/2009/10/sony-allpanel-concept.jpg" alt="sony-allpanel-concept" width="523" height="376" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/10/sony-allpanel-concept.jpg 523w, /images/fromwp/2009/10/sony-allpanel-concept-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" />

I think i&#8217;m (even more) in love with the future now.

* Oh, and [not so recently](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/12/sonys-flexible-oled-mockups/) it seems. This design was originally seen in public in January. How did i miss it?
