Well blow me down with a feather, it seems my &#8220;[MacBook DS](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/shiny-new-apple-products/)&#8221; idea isn't original. Sony has [recently](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/06/video-sonys-ceatec-concept-party-includes-walkman-bracelet-and/)[^fn-failingkeeneyes] been showing off its beautiful &#8220;all-panel laptop&#8221; concept&#8230;

I think i'm (even more) in love with the future now.

[^fn-failingkeeneyes] Oh, and [not so recently](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/12/sonys-flexible-oled-mockups/) it seems. This design was originally seen in public in January. How did i miss it?
