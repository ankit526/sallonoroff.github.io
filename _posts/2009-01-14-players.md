Shortly before Christmas ITV started pushing the re-branding of their online TV catch-up service as &#8220;<a href="http://www.itv.com/catchup" target="_blank">itv Player</a>&#8221; . What an original name. The logo is epsecially creative. Nothing at all like the BBC&#8217;s online TV catch-up service <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer" target="_blank">iPlayer</a> launched some time ago&#8230;

Not bad, eh? What really hurts is that some marketing team at ITV is being very well-paid to come up with such wonderful work. Or worse still, some external agency creative-types are being paid even better still to be massively uncreative.
