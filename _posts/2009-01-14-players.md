Shortly before Christmas ITV started pushing the re-branding of their online TV catch-up service as [itv Player](http://www.itv.com/catchup). What an original name. The logo is epsecially creative. Nothing at all like the BBC's online TV catch-up service [iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) launched some time ago...

Not bad, eh? What really hurts is that some marketing team at ITV is being very well-paid to come up with such wonderful work. Or worse still, some external agency creative-types are being paid even better still to be massively uncreative.
