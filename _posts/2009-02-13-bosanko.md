![Bosanko - Come In Peace](/images/fromwp/2009/02/photo432271_comeinpeace58.jpg)
[Michael Bosanko](http://www.michaelbosanko.com)'s light graffiti &#8211; incredibly beautiful.

[Apparently](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gallery/2009/feb/12/michael-bosanko-light-graffiti) no photoshopping involved here &#8211; it's all done with glow sticks and long exposures. I'm curious to know how the artist isn't captured in the image moving between each object though&#8230;?
