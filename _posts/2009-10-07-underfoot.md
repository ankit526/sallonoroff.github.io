Another one for the &#8220;i thought of that&#8221; catalogue it seems&#8230;

[Core77 report](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/progress_on_powerleap_energyharnessing_floor_tiles_14870.asp) on [Elizabeth Redmond's POWERleap tiles](http://changents.com/powerleaper) which generate electricity from being walked over.

A simple but brilliant idea (if i do say so myself) with massive potential (imagine if this sort of technology was able to be set into road surfaces). It's an idea that is probably quite difficult to realise but I really, really hope this one bears fruit.
