Another one for the &#8220;i thought of that&#8221; catalogue it seems&#8230;

[Core77 report](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/progress_on_powerleap_energyharnessing_floor_tiles_14870.asp) on [Elizabeth Redmond](http://changents.com/powerleaper)&#8216;s POWERleap tiles which generate electricity from being walked over.

A simple but brilliant idea (if i do say so myself) with massive potential (imagine if this sort of technology was able to be set into road surfaces). It&#8217;s a idea that is probably quite difficult to realise but I really, really hope this bears fruit.
