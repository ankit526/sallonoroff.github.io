Hello. Apologies for the lack of updates &#8211; i know you've all been on the edge of your seats to discover how this stupid little experiment is going, especially since i swore to try some new numbers. Here's how i did on the 22nd May (ICBM draw #12)&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **01, 04, 16, 37, 47, 49** + bonus ball **27**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **0**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Wunderbar! And on the 29th May (ICBM draw #13)&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **02, 17, 36, 39, 42, 48** + bonus ball **41**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **0**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Can you tell i'm getting really, really bored of this? Gambling has never been so dull. Maybe if the balances stopped looking like this i'd be happier:

**Lottery balance: £-13  //  Not A Lottery balance: £13**
