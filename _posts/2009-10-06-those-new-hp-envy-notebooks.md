When HP announced their new ENVY line of notebooks, i couldn't help but [remark](http://twitter.com/sallonoroff/) on how similar they looked to Apple's unibody MacBooks. Needless to say, I was very interested to see how they'd compare beyond appearances. There's been a little wait, butÂ Engadget now have a proper review of these machines online: [looky-looky](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/05/hp-envy-13-review/). It's quite a positive piece... until we discover that the trackpad is virtually impossible to use. Oh.

Also, for what it's worth[^fn-fuckall], i think that textured pattern on the palm-rest area (which wasn't apparent in HP's publicity shots but is in Engadget's own pics) looks really nasty. Like the HP designers went and stole a bit of the Dell Adamo after they'd finished being &#8220;inspired&#8221; by the MacBook.

Nice try HP. More work required though it seems.

[^fn-fuckall]: A close approximation to zero.
