When HP announced their new ENVY line of notebooks, i couldn&#8217;t help but [remark](http://twitter.com/sallonoroff/) on how similar they looked to Apple&#8217;s unibody MacBooks. Needless to say, I was very interested to see how they&#8217;d compare beyond appearances. There&#8217;s been a little wait, butÂ Engadget now have a proper review of these machines online&#8230; [looky-looky](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/05/hp-envy-13-review/). It&#8217;s quite a positive piece &#8211; until we discover that the trackpad is virtually impossible to use. Oh.

Also, for what it&#8217;s worth*, i think that textured pattern on the palm-rest area (which wasn&#8217;t apparent in HP&#8217;s publicity shots but is in Engadget&#8217;s own pics) looks really nasty. Like the HP designers went and stole a bit of the Dell Adamo after they&#8217;d finished being &#8220;inspired&#8221; by the MacBook .

Nice try HP. More work required though it seems.
