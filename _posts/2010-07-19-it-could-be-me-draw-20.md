Here&#8217;s the outcome of the 20th weekly It Could Be Me lottery draw&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **15, 28, 32, 43, 44, 45** + bonus ball **20**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Another disappointing result. I&#8217;m seriously toying with the idea of trying to employ Sod&#8217;s Law to ensure i win, by promising to give two-thirds of the money away to charity or something.

**Lottery balance: £-20  //  Not A Lottery balance: £20.02**
