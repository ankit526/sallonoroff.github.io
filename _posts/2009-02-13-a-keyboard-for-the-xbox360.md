Inputting text on the XBOX360 with the game controller is very tiresome for more than a couple of (very short) words, so when i discovered that any old USB PC keyboard would work with the text-entry portions of the XBOX dashboard i had to get one. Problem was, i didn&#8217;t want a big cumbersome PC keyboard lying about in front of the telly.

The solution, i thought, would be one of those dinky little, numpad-free keyboards that seem terribly undersized for everyday use on a PC&#8230; but fortunately whilst searching for one of those i came across something even better &#8211; [flexible silicone keyboards](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/134817). These can be rolled up and tucked away somewhere when not in use. Perfect.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-201" title="flexikb" src="/images/fromwp/2009/02/flexikb.jpg" alt="flexikb" width="360" height="236" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/02/flexikb.jpg 400w, /images/fromwp/2009/02/flexikb-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />Mine arrived yesterday and works well, allowing for much quicker text entry&#8230; and, unexpectedly, it also allows navigation around the XBOX dashboard interface (cursor keys to move around, Return to select, Esc for back and Windows key opens the &#8220;Quick Launch&#8221; pop-up).

In terms of hardware quality the device is about what i expected for Â£7.50 &#8211; an unknown brand, a cheapo tinfoil USB lead and several unmarked keys. That said, it&#8217;s not too bad looking and actually feels pretty durable. Admittedly, any sort of USB keyboard lacks the convenience of the [official Messenger Pad](http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/hardware/x/xbox360messengerkit/) but it was a fraction of the price, which is more important given how infrequently i&#8217;ll use it.

Oh, and if you&#8217;re going to buy one of these yourself, watchout for the entrepreneurial souls on eBay selling these as &#8220;[XBOX Live Messenger Keyboards](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280310600367)&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s the same shit but twice the price.
