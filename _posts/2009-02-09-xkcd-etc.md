[xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) is a comic that gets a lot of mentions on (particularly geeky parts of) the web but i've never really been a fan. Occasionally, there is a gem though. Such as [today's](http://xkcd.com/541/).

And i have to admit [this one](http://xkcd.com/538/) from last week also raised a smile.

Such a shame that nerdy comic strips (you might choose to call them &#8220;webcomics&#8221; but then i'd have to start disliking you &#8211; assuming I didn't already) like this are so hit and miss. [Joy of Tech](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/) is another that looks promising but in reality only produces something great every [now](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/669.html) and [then](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/734.html).

No, it seems if you want consistant amusement then there's only one option &#8211; [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com/strips).
