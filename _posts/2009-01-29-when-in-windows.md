Two graphics programs i couldn&#8217;t live without when stuck using a Windows machine (as i am everyday at work) and, if i&#8217;m totally honest, wish existed for the Mac&#8230;

[IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) _by Irfan Skiljan_

[Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) _by Rick Brewster/dotPDN LLC_

Both free, both lightweight and both, as i said, indespensible if you have any image manipulation to do. Irfanview i use primarily for saving screen-grabs but it also has a great batch conversion tool. Paint.NET is like MSPaint&#8217;s bigger, cooler brother. When you don&#8217;t have access to Photoshop (or can&#8217;t wait for it to load) then Paint.NET is an excellent quick and simple alternative.

While i&#8217;m on the topic of free software, i&#8217;ll also quickly mention NCH Software. They write lots of applications. Some commerical, some freely available&#8230; but from what i&#8217;ve used so far, all good. [VideoPad](http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html), which recently helped me out of a spot, is a nice little video editor and one of the few free ones to be found on the web. The other prog that i&#8217;ve found really handy to have about is [Switch](http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html) &#8211; i recently used the new Mac version of this to convert some music from WMA to a more iTunes-friendly MP3 (since MacOSX iTunes won&#8217;t do the conversion, even though Windows iTunes will).
