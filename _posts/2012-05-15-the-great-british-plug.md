After reading [that Tesla comic](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2012/05/the-greatest-geek-who-ever-lived/), one thing led to another and I found myself hunting out an article i&#8217;d read years ago comparing the world&#8217;s domestic power supplies. It turns out it was this [&#8220;Plug versus Plug&#8221; piece by CNET](http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/plug-versus-plug-49303764/) from 2009. If you&#8217;re polite, you might say the article is &#8220;light-hearted&#8221;. Personally, i think i&#8217;d opt for &#8220;daft bollocks thrown together on a Friday afternoon&#8221;. That said, I rather enjoyed reading it (and enough so to remember it years later). Ignore the daft and it&#8217;s a nice reminder that Britain is capable of great planning and engineering, and that our 3-pronged beauty is actually something to be proud of.
