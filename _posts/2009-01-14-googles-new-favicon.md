[Google has implemented a new favicon](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html) which is gradually appearing on all their websites. Personally, i hate it. I get the idea but i think it just looks far too brash and gaudy. I prefer the old favicon - much more subtle than this new one and more elegant than the original capital G. But who cares what i think?
