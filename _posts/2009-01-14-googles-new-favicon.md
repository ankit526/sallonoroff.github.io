<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html" target="_blank">Google has implemented a new favicon</a> which is gradually appearing on all their websites. Personally, i hate it. I &#8220;get&#8221; the idea but i think it just looks far too brash and gaudy. I prefer the old favicon &#8211; much more subtle than this new one and more elegant than the original capital G. But who cares what i think?
