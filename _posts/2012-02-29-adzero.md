This is the [ADzero](http://www.justadzero.com/), a smartphone made from bamboo (or rosewood), designed by British studentÂ [Kieran-Scott Woodhouse](http://kieron-scott.com/). I like this a lot. It looks fantastic and is hopefully a little more eco-friendly than more traditional kit. Unfortunately, it's pretty much just a concept right now. The above photograph is of prototypes (read: non-functioning models) but supposedly they're going to get these beauties [into production](http://www.reghardware.com/2012/02/02/concept_bamboo_smartphone_adzero_in_production/) by the end of the year. Good luck to them &#8211; I'd be very interested to see (and feel) one of these in person.

There are more photos at the [ADzero website](http://www.justadzero.com/) and a video [interview with Woodhouse at The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/26/2824720/the-verge-interview-kieron-scott-woodhouse-head-designer-at-adzero).
