My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

I _still_ fancy changing my numbers but _still_ haven’t bothered. I _still_ expect there'll be another penny of interest in the Not a Lottery bank account too but i _still_ haven’t checked it yet.

**Lottery balance: £-37.00  |  Not A Lottery balance: £37.05**
