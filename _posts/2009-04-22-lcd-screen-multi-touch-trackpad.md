[The Register has a peek](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/04/21/sharp_mebius/) at an upcoming Small, Cheap Computer™ from Sharp called the Mebius. It&#8217;s pretty much the usual netbook fayre&#8230; except for the inclusion of a reasonably large, multi-touch trackpad which is also an LCD screen. The video of it that the Reg show just depicts it being used for doodling but there&#8217;s a ton of potential for such a component. I hope this is something we see other manufacturers pick up on.

Just a shame that the Mebius looks like it won&#8217;t be all that cheap, like a lot of the more recent netbooks&#8230;
