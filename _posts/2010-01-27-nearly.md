In less than 2 hours from now, Apple will reveal their &#8220;latest creation&#8221;. All [rumours](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/26/the-apple-tablet-rumor-roundup/) point to a tablet-type device and every mac/tech website in the world is carrying their version of what may or may not transpire today. I&#8217;m not going to bother guessing the specifics of what Apple will announce, as i&#8217;ll surely be proven wrong but i do have a few thoughts on the rumours circulating. Namely&#8230;

**Will the tablet run the iPhone OS, Mac OSX or some new variant?**

I say it has to run the iPhone&#8217;s version of OSX, or some new fork of that system. A cynic (_hello!_) may say that Apple wants to maintain and extend the iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;app&#8221; ecosystem &#8211; simply ensuring that they get a cut of all application sales for their platform, unlike the big fat nothing they get on the Mac. However, there&#8217;s actually a more obvious and sensible reason that it won&#8217;t run full Mac OSX&#8230; it won&#8217;t be powerful enough. To make a tablet that&#8217;s thin enough and light enough to be conveniently held and carried Apple won&#8217;t be putting in regular laptop-spec innards &#8211; they&#8217;ll be going with a beefier version of the iPhone&#8217;s workings. (Though of course if i&#8217;m right, we&#8217;ll never officially be told the internal spec &#8211; just like the iPhone. The end-user needn&#8217;t know or care what powers it.)

**Will there be two versions of the tablet?**

The rumours say that, following the iPod touch and iPhone trend, there&#8217;ll be wifi and wifi-and-3g versions of the tablet available. I don&#8217;t buy it though. The difference between the touch and the iPhone is more than the 3g connectivity &#8211; it is the _phone_ functionality. A tablet with 3g isn&#8217;t going to have any extra functionality &#8211; it&#8217;d just mean you had a much better chance of staying &#8220;connected&#8221;.  This might justify a slightly higher price tag for the 3g-enabled model&#8230; but then a 3g-enabled model could be flogged by the mobile telcos at a subsidised price, assuming you sign-up for their 3g service. Where does that leave you? Two tablets but the one with less functionality costing more. No chance. I reckon there&#8217;s one tablet. One tablet with wifi and 3g connectivity.

**How much will the tablet cost?**

The rumours say we&#8217;ll be looking at $800-1000 (or about £700-800) but obviously less if you get one on contract from a telco. This sounds expensive for a (computationally) low-powered machine when you can pick up any one of a vast number of netbooks and low-end laptops for much, much less money&#8230; but remember that an unlocked iPhone 3GS costs at least £450. I think that the rumour-mill has it about right on this occasion. Of course Apple may charge much more for this initial release knowing full-well that plenty of fanboys will pay anything but i actually wouldn&#8217;t be very  surprised if Apple shocked the world with a (reasonably) low price tag. After-all, the iPhone-without-the-phone-bits (iPod touch) only retails at £239 (for a 32GB model, vs £549 for a 32GB iPhone 3GS).

Of course, while i&#8217;m as excited as everyone else to see what Apple produces tonight, it doesn&#8217;t actually matter that much to me because i won&#8217;t be buying a tablet*. My next Apple purchase will ([at long last](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/10/decisions-decisions/)) be an iPhone &#8211; so i&#8217;ll be more interested to see what today&#8217;s announcements mean for that device. Will it get a price cut? Will tablet interface details point to obvious updates to the iPhone hardware? Will OS4.0 updates by themselves be enough reason to wait for the next iPhone? Fingers-crossed all this and more will be answered in a few short hours.

* Unless they _are_ shockingly cheap.

**Update:** Oh, and remember&#8230;
