It seems a load of the videos i'd embedded here over the years were broken and/or reliant on Flash Player (same thing?), so i've just been through the site and updated the embed code used. We're now using WordPress' very simple [embed tag](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) and hopefully you'll now be able to watch these clips on any device ([thanks to YouTube defaulting to HTML5 video](http://youtube-eng.blogspot.jp/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html)). Let me know if you happen across any videos that are still broken.

I think my favourite re-discovery in carrying out this little bit of admin is [Microsoft's vision of technology of 2019](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/ten-years-time/). This video is now 6 years old and so we're just 4 years away from this tech. Awesome.
