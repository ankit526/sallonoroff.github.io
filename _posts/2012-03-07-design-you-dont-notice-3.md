I was just casually perusing [Gary Allen&#8217;s](http://www.ifoapplestore.com/) [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ifostore/sets/72157629143777004/with/6951762181/) of the new Apple Store in Amsterdam when i was struck by the caption of [this image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ifostore/6951762181)&#8230;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ifostore/6951762181"><img class="size-full wp-image-1628 aligncenter" title="Apple Store Amsterdam ceiling detail" src="/images/fromwp/2012/03/ifostore_amsterdam_vents.jpg" alt="Apple Store Amsterdam ceiling detail" width="500" height="333" srcset="/images/fromwp/2012/03/ifostore_amsterdam_vents.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2012/03/ifostore_amsterdam_vents-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>
</p>

Another example of Apple&#8217;s passion for aesthetics and fantastic attention to detail. And a fantastic spot by Gary.
