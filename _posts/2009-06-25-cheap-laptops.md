[Here&#8217;s a piece](http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/23/entelligence-netbooks-r-i-p/) by Gartenberg (on Engadget rather than his own [blog](http://gartenblog.net/)) on the topic of &#8220;netbooks&#8221;. Basically he reckons the success of Small, Cheap Computers™ is down to the &#8220;Cheap&#8221; part of the it rather than anything else, and i&#8217;m inclined to agree. There are a lot of people who just need a computer &#8220;to get on the web&#8221; and if it handles the odd bit of word processing too then that&#8217;s a bonus. Of course these consumers will plump for the cheapest suitable device they can find. If the success of netbooks was really about the compactness and portability of the machines, they&#8217;d still be 7-9&#8243; (screen size) devices but they aren&#8217;t. Netbooks are getting bigger and bigger.
