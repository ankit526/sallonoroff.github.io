Almost a year ago [I wrote about](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2015/05/the-camera-that-follows-you/) the [Lily camera](https://www.lily.camera/) &#8211; a drone that automatically follows you around, photographing and filming your every move. It looked amazing in the marketing video but far from ready in a hands-on video I had found. It was due to ship February 2016 but at the time of writing still isn&#8217;t available.

You might recall, [I also commented](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2015/07/the-other-camera-that-follows-you/) on the similar [Hexo+](https://hexoplus.com/) drone, which was more expensive (and required a separate Go Pro camera purchase) but also a bit more polished. Clearly it was: the Hexo+ is now available to buy (for a cool $1000).

Today I want to mention another of these follow-me drones I just learnt about: [Hover Camera by Zero Zero Robotics](http://gethover.com). This thing appears to be more floating selfie-stick than the automatic outdoor-adventure cameraman of the Lily or Hexo+, but it&#8217;s equally impressive:

Sure that&#8217;s glossy promotional material by Zero Zero themselves, but go take a look at [the hands-on feature that Engadget have published](http://www.engadget.com/2016/04/26/hover-camera-drone-zero-zero-robotics/) too. I remain impressed. The video footage captured by the drone definitely looks like it still needs work (I see much stuttering), but it&#8217;s small and light and the follow-me features look great. So, yet another to keep an eye on.
