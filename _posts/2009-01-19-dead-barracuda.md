If your 1TB Seagate Barracuda drive just failed, take some solace in the fact that [you are not alone](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/16/barracuda_failure_plague/). You may also be very pleased to [read](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/18/barracuda_firmware_upgrade_and_recovery/) that Seagate are doing The Right Thingâ„¢ and not just replacing your knackered drive but also offering free data recovery. I am impressed.

Seagate have for a long time been my preferred hard drive manufacturer but have lately been slipping in my estimations. I've had a couple of problems with 2.5&#8243; drives from them and now there's this incredible failure rate on desktop drives. I hoped when they took-over Maxtor that Seagate's goodness might rub off, not Maxtor's crappiness drag down Seagate. I guess time will tell. And i'll find out first-hand since i recently purchased a [500GB external Maxtor drive](http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/installation_assistance/installation_instructions/external_drives_&_personal_servers/maxtor-basics)[^fn-cheapskate] for use with [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/timemachine.html).

[^fn-cheapskate]: It seems a January Sales bargain is all i need to overcome brand preference.
