If your 1TB Seagate Barracuda drive just failed, take some solace in the fact that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/16/barracuda_failure_plague/" target="_blank">you are not alone</a>. You may also be very pleased to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/18/barracuda_firmware_upgrade_and_recovery/" target="_blank">read</a> that Seagate are doing The Right Thingâ„¢ and not just replacing your knackered drive but also offering free data recovery. I am impressed.

Seagate have for a long time been my preferred hard drive manufacturer but have lately been slipping in my estimations. I&#8217;ve had a couple of problems with 2.5&#8243; drives from them and now there&#8217;s this incredible failure rate on desktop drives. I hoped when they took-over Maxtor that Seagate&#8217;s goodness might rub off, not Maxtor&#8217;s crappiness drag down Seagate. I guess time will tell. And i&#8217;ll find out first-hand since i recently purchased a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/installation_assistance/installation_instructions/external_drives_&_personal_servers/maxtor-basics" target="_blank">500GB external Maxtor drive</a> (it seems a January Sales bargain is all i need to overcome Brand-preferences) for use with <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/timemachine.html" target="_blank">Time Machine</a>.
