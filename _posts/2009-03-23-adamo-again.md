I've just read [The Inquirer's take](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/478/1051478/dell-usd2-adamo-laptop-spotted) on Dell's new Adamo. There's nothing particularly new in the text of the article but they have got a few good hands-on photos of the &#8220;pearl&#8221; model, which does look a lot whiter than in Dell's PR shots. If these pics are truly representative then, with that two-tone lid and ring-patterned base, the Adamo is even less attractive than i [originally thought](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/adamo-by-dell/). Such a shame.
