It has been a very busy two weeks for world&#8217;s tech journalists. Three quite unexpected &#8211; and thus very big &#8211; news stories. I&#8217;ve wanted to write about them individually but just not got around to it, so here&#8217;s a quick round-up in which i&#8217;ll pass you over to the bigger boys for more information, should you want it.

**15th August &#8211; Google buys Motorola**

Or rather, [Google have announced they&#8217;re buying Motorola Mobility](http://thisismynext.com/2011/08/15/google-buy-motorola-mobility-hardware-business/) &#8211; Motorola&#8217;s mobile phone and tablet business &#8211; for the princely sum of 12.5 billion dollars. Kerching! The [official line](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html) is that this allows Google to &#8220;supercharge&#8221; the Android phone OS and ecosystem. Whatever that means. The surprise news prompted much speculation about whether this deal is about obtaining Motorola&#8217;s patents (to use against Apple, etc) or about bringing Android hardware design in-house. Or both, of course. The takeover also raises questions about the future of Android support from other device manufacturers, now that Google could potentially give itself preferentialÂ treatment.

**18th August &#8211; HP looks to dump its PC business and kill off webOS devices**

[HP has decided](http://www.precentral.net/breaking-hp-shutting-down-webos-device-operations-will-continue-explore-options) it&#8217;s going to sell off its personal computer division and also stop it&#8217;s webOS-based phone and tablet hardware operations. The shock here, of course, is that HP is the world&#8217;s largest PC manufacturer (by unit sales). And that they only bought Palm &#8211; the company behind webOS, the Pre phone and ultimately the TouchPad tablet &#8211; little more than a year ago (and only released the TouchPad less than 2 months ago). But then, HP&#8217;s new CEO is a software and services man, so maybe it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.

**24th August &#8211; Steve Jobs resigns from position of CEO at Apple**

Yep, [he&#8217;s stepping down](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html). Apple&#8217;s legendary co-founder has decided to hand the reins over to Tim Cook. You&#8217;d think from the coverage in the mainstream media that Apple was up shit creek now, and from the out-pouring of stories and anecdotes about Steve on the mac-web that he&#8217;d died. Fact is, he remains an employee at Apple and will chair the board. In other words, this move is all about putting investor&#8217;s &#8220;succession&#8221; fears and doubts to bed. Steve will no doubt still have much influence over Apple&#8217;s future work.

[Here&#8217;s an excellent piece on Mr Jobs&#8217; resignation](http://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned) by John Gruber at Daring Fireball.
