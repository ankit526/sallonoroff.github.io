It has dawned on me just how neglected this blog is. If you want to blame (or thank) anyone or thing for this, then you should probably look in the direction of [twitter](http://twitter.com/sallonoroff). I seem to spend my digital life over there now. Not actually doing anything useful or productive you understand, rather i read other&#8217;s witticisms and try to produce some myself (unsuccessfully).

I&#8217;ve [written before](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/06/neglect/) how i took up twitter in order to compliment this &#8220;tech&#8221; blog but that it didn&#8217;t end up working out like that. Now it seems i might make more use of this blog if i simply use it as an extension to my twittering &#8211; a place for thoughts that can&#8217;t be recorded in just 140 characters.

Or maybe it&#8217;ll remain neglected.
