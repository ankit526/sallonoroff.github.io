It seems that the BBC being forced into making iPlayer flash-based (so that licence-fee payers running OSX or Linux could use the service) has made the other stations sit up and take note. Yes, i realised last week that all 5 of the UK's &#8220;terrestrial&#8221; channels now have a free online offering and, best of all, they all work whether you're on a PC or Mac. Like the BBC, Five uses a flash player now and Channel4 has dumped it's Windows Media-based system for a flash offering too. Sadly ITV has only gone as far as switching to Microsoft's Silverlight (MS's attempt at a Flash killer) but at least it's not Windows-only.
