It seems that the BBC being forced into making iPlayer flash-based (so that licence-fee payers running OSX or Linux could use the service) has made the other stations sit up and take note. Yes, i realised last week that all 5 of the UK&#8217;s &#8220;terrestrial&#8221; channels now have a free online offering and, best of all, they all work whether you&#8217;re on a PC or Mac. Like the BBC, Five uses a flash player now and Channel4 has dumped it&#8217;s Windows Media-based system for a flash offering too. Sadly ITV has only gone as far as switching to Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight (MS&#8217;s attempt at a Flash killer) but at least it&#8217;s not Windows-only.
