After recently [writing about the Lily drone camera](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2015/05/the-camera-that-follows-you/) I was contacted by the PR people for [Hexo+](https://hexoplus.com/), who wanted to let me know about their very similar product. It's pricier than the Lily and doesn't include a camera (you have to attach your own GoPro to it) but it also looks like it is much nearer completion. See what you think:
