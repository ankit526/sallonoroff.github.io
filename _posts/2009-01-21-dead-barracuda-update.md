...Don't update!

As i [mentioned](/blog/2009/01/dead-barracuda/) the other day, SeagateÂ  are replacing bricked Barracuda drives and offering free data recovery to customers affected, but they also pushed out a firmware update to patch the hard drives that are still working. Only, [it seems](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/530/1050530/seagate-bungles-firmware-update) they've cocked that up and the &#8220;fix&#8221; just bricks working drives.
