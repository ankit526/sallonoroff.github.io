In digging up those links to Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;hidden&#8221; utilities for my [last post](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/microsoft-add-ins-add-ons/), i re-discovered a few other links to useful (and free!) tools for Windows. They&#8217;re not things i&#8217;ve used extensively or very often so i won&#8217;t be including them on the [Downloads](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/downloads/) page but i thought i&#8217;d list them here should they be of use to someone. Somewhere. Maybe.

[Trend Micro SysClean](http://www.trendmicro.com/download/dcs.asp) &#8211; The SysClean package available on this page is a really thorough anti-virus scanner useful for clearing an infected computer (you&#8217;ll also need the virus patterns file from [here](http://www.trendmicro.com/download/pattern.asp)).

[McAfee Stinger](http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/) &#8211; Tiny, stand-alone anti-virus scanner that removes just the nastiest of bugs.

[ClamWin](http://www.clamwin.com/) &#8211; Free, open-source anti-virus scanner for Windows based on the [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/) engine. ([ClamXav](http://www.clamxav.com/) is an OSX anti-virus program based on this engine too)

[CobianBackup](http://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobianbackup.htm) &#8211; Allows you to create backup copies of your work according to schedule or on demand.

[Roxio UDF Reader](http://www.roxio.com/enu/support/udf/software_updates.html) / [Nero InCD Reader](http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads-nero9-tools-utilities.html#tab1) &#8211; Some people will insist on using CDs as re-writable disks. If you get sent such a CD and don&#8217;t have the appropriate software already installed, you may find these &#8220;readers&#8221; rather useful.

[InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) &#8211; Create a Windows installer for your own programs.

[ISObuster](http://www.isobuster.com/isobuster.php) &#8211; Tool for aiding recovery of data from lightly damaged or dud CDs and DVDs.

[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) &#8211; Open-source utitlity for comparing files and folders. Allows differencing and merging of text files.

[NirSoft Password Recovery Tools](http://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html) &#8211; A bunch of programs for recovering passwords saved in Outlook, IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc.
