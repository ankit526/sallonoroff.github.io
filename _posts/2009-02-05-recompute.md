Some bloke has created [a cardboard computer case for the Greener Gadgets Design Competition](http://www.core77.com/greenergadgets/entry.php?projectid=32). A little bit bulky but i kind of like it. And apparently the Core2Duo innards [won't set it ablaze](http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/05/recompute-a-closer-look-at-the-sustainable-cardboard-pc/), if you were about to point out the seemingly obvious.

Other entries to the competition include [a concrete external hard drive](http://www.core77.com/greenergadgets/entry.php?projectid=69) and [a printer](http://www.core77.com/greenergadgets/entry.php?projectid=38) that uses tea and coffee dregs as ink (although these two seem to be more about &#8220;statement&#8221; than any sort of usefulness).
