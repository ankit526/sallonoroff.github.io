Apple has posted a video of their event at the Cupertino headquarters for staff to mark the passing of Steve Jobs and celebrate his life and work. Visit [apple.com/celebrating-steve](http://www.apple.com/celebrating-steve/) to watch the video stream.

If you don't fancy watching the whole 80-or-so minutes of footage then might i suggest you at least watch Jonny Ive's speech at about the 47 minute mark. It's lovely &#8211; equally amusing and touching.

Oh, and one interesting thing i noticed: Not a single person reads their speech from an iPad. It's an all paper affair. How curious.
