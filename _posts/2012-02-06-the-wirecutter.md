Since i'm labelled by friends and family as &#8220;good with computers&#8221; i'm often asked for advice on buying computers, phones and just about all other forms of consumer tech. The problem is, unless i happen to have recently researched for myself whatever sort of device they're after, i rarely have a device name to give and am only able to offer tips on finding something suitable. The other part of the problem is that i don't like being given responsibility for other people's money. That sort of confidence &#8211; to tell people they should definitely buy this phone or that laptop &#8211; isn't in my nature. Thankfully there are brash, extrovert Americans who are more than happy to oblige&#8230; say hello to [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/).
