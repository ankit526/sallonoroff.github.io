Since i&#8217;m labelled by friends and family as &#8220;good with computers&#8221; i&#8217;m often asked for advice on buying computers, phones and just about all other forms of consumer tech. The problem is, unless i happen to have recently researched for myself whatever sort of device they&#8217;re after, i rarely have a device name to give and am only able to offer tips on finding something suitable. The other part of the problem is that i don&#8217;t like being given responsibility for other people&#8217;s money. That sort of confidence &#8211; to tell people they should definitely buy this phone or that laptop &#8211; isn&#8217;t in my nature. Thankfully there are brash, extrovert Americans who are more than happy to oblige&#8230; say hello to [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/).
