I've usually no time for Bono but I was impressed by his bit on [Jonathan Ive in the 2013 TIME 100 listing](http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/jonathan-ive/).

> _His genius is not just his ability to see what others cannot but also how he applies it. To watch him with his workmates in the holy of holies, Apple’s design lab, or on a night out is to observe a very rare esprit de corps. They love their boss, and he loves them. What the competitors don’t seem to understand is you cannot get people this smart to work this hard just for money._

**PS.** Yes, this is from April. I'm still catching up with lots of things i&#8217;d starred in Google Reader for later reading.
