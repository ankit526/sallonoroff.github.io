I've just changed the blog's &#8220;tagline&#8221;Â (that subheading up there at the top of the page, but under &#8220;sallonoroff&#8221;) from:

_some thoughts on technology, recorded for future embarrassment._

to:

_some thoughts on things made with ones and noughts._

I only realised the other day that i'd missed out on this rhyming reference to binary. Yes, the change comes at the cost of some self-deprecation but i can't deny the world such examples of my Mad Skillz, baby.
