Here&#8217;s a really, really, really great [blog post by John Siracusa titled &#8220;Hypercritical&#8221;](http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars) which discusses the importance of criticism in creativity. I probably enjoyed the essay so much because i feel like it&#8217;s something i could have written (save comparing myself to Wolverine and Steve Jobs &#8211; i lack that level of self-confidence) or attempted to write anyway. Fortunately for you, dear reader, Mr Siracusa is better at transcribing his thoughts than yours truly.
