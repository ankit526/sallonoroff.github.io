For 52 weeks, from March 2010 to March 2011, I ran a daft experiment that i referred to as &#8220;[It Could Be Me](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/tag/it-could-be-me/)&#8220;. The idea was that i&#8217;d &#8220;invest&#8221; £1 every week in playing Saturday&#8217;s National Lottery and at the same time i&#8217;d put £1 in a savings account, then after a year see which was most profitable. In the [end](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2011/02/it-could-be-me-draw-52/), the results were unsurprising but i promised further analysis and a conclusion, so here it is. (Just a few months late.)

**What happened?**

Over the year i played several different sets of numbers. I started with 06, 09, 16, 23, 27, 32 (now to be known as Set1), playing that line for 11 weeks. It won nothing. For the next 29 weeks i played the line 06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44 (Set2) but they won nothing either. In desperation, for the last 12 weeks of the experiment i switched to Lucky Dip numbers (lines of numbers drawn randomly for you). These were unfruitful too.

Thus, after a year of playing, the final balance of my lottery investment was -£52. The final balance of the savings investment was £52.14. So therefore we can say that you&#8217;re over £100 a year better off banking a pound a week than playing the lottery. Or alternatively, you&#8217;re 14 pence better off a year banking a pound a week than doing nothing with it. Check me! I&#8217;m the new Martin &#8220;Money Saving Expert&#8221; Lewis.

**What would&#8217;ve happened if&#8230;?**

Having not won a single penny on the lottery, i started (as i&#8217;m sure gamblers all do) to wonder &#8220;what if?&#8221; What if i&#8217;d played Set1 all year instead of swapping? What if I&#8217;d stuck with Set2? What if i&#8217;d played Set2 from the beginning of the experiment? And so on.

Well, thanks to historical number checkers ([such as this one](http://www.lottohideout.co.uk/lottery-checker/lotto.html)) we can easily find out what would&#8217;ve happened if&#8230;

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played Set1 for all 52 weeks?_ I would&#8217;ve had one £10 win. So the lottery investment would&#8217;ve only ended up as £42 loss.

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played Set2 for the remainder of the experiment (instead of switching to Lucky Dips)?_ Nothing. I&#8217;d have still lost £52.

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played Set2 from the start and for all 52 weeks?_ Again, nothing. I&#8217;d have still lost £52.

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played any of the Lucky Dip lines for all 52 weeks?_ Yeah, you guessed it, not a lot. (Best outcome from any of those 12 Lucky Dip lines was an overall loss of £13)

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played Set1 in both Saturday and Wednesday draws for 52 weeks?_ One win but now twice the outlay, so an overall loss of £94.

_&#8230;i&#8217;d played Set2 in both Saturday and Wednesday draws for 52 weeks?_ Four £10 wins&#8230; but that still means an overall loss of £64.

Do you see a pattern emerging yet?

Thanks to historical number checkers it is possible to see that even had i played Set1 in EVERY National Lottery Lotto draw ever made i would have lost £1225 (that&#8217;s £398 of winnings, against £1,623 in ticket costs). Similarly, using Set2 in all draws to date would have lost me £1114 (£509 in winnings, £1623 in costs). In fact, put in just about any random set of 6 numbers and you will find that the total winnings lies somewhere between £300 and £700 &#8211; much, much less than you&#8217;ve spent on buying the tickets.

So there we go. No surprises. Playing the lottery is an absolute mug&#8217;s game. You&#8217;d be an utter fool to do it. Your money is better off in the bank. It&#8217;s even better off under the bed. You won&#8217;t win big.

And that&#8217;s why i no longer play the lottery. Or, why i wouldn&#8217;t if it wasn&#8217;t for this stupid little optimistic glimmer that says one day It Could Be Me.
