Long-time gluttons-for-punishment (readers) may recall [a little post i made back in february](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/bosanko/) about an artist called Michael Bosanko, who creates incredible images with glow-sticks. Light graffiti, if you will.

Light graffiti? What, like in those TalkTalk adverts and the TalkTalk &#8220;idents&#8221; for the X-Factor? Yes, like those.  Just like those. Because they&#8217;re done by Bosanko. Look, [here](http://xfactornews.talktalk.co.uk/blog/57/talktalk/brightening-up-britains-landmarks) (and [here](http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/2009/08/12/1250064420000.html)) are TalkTalk telling you all about how they toured the UK with him to produce the pictures for their ads.

I think the pics from Sheffield are particularly lovely, but i may be biased&#8230;

All of the images from the ads, including 6 from Sheffield, can be found [on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41325962@N05/) or head over to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/talktalkvids) for a collection of videos, including a &#8220;how to&#8221; by the artist&#8230;
