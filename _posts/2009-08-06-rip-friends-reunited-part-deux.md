The big (general-public-friendly) tech [ne](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/06/friendsreunited_itv_sold/)[ws](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8186840.stm) today is that ITV _have_ managed to sell Friends Reunited. The original &#8220;social networking&#8221; website was bought by BrightSolid Ltd for 25 million quid. You may recall that [back in February](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/ripfriendsreunited/) when the FT revealed that ITV were looking for a buyer i had this to say&#8230;

> _My money is on ITV selling it (at a massive loss) to some relatively unknown outfit and the brand just disappearing completely within 6 months of the sale…_

Well, i got the massive loss bit right (somewhere in the region of £100million-150million) and i reckon that i didn&#8217;t do so badly on the &#8220;relatively unknown outfit&#8221; call either. I&#8217;ve never heard of BrightSolid (have you?) but apparently they&#8217;re a subsidiary of publishers DC Thomson (Beano comics, etc) and mainly deal with online genealogy stuff. Presumably that means they&#8217;ve bought FR for the &#8220;GenesReunited&#8221; customers more than anything else. As for my prediction that FR will disappear completely within 6 months of any sale, well, the clock is now ticking&#8230; Call back next February to see just how wrong I am.

Now excuse me while i go and delete my Friends Reunited account&#8230;
