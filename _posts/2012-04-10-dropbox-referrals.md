I just noticed that my [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) quota has increased. Bit of a surprise, because as far as I was aware I hadn&#8217;t done anything to warrant it. It turns out [the Dropbox team have doubled the amount of extra space you&#8217;re gifted for referring people to the service](http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=1096)&#8230; **and applied this retroactively**. So every 250MB bonus you&#8217;ve ever had is now a 500MB bonus. Nice.

Incidentally, if you fancy signing up for the most excellent Dropbox service, then perhaps you could use [THIS LINK](http://db.tt/7coj3Qg) to do so and we&#8217;ll both bag an extra 500 meg of free storage. Ta.
