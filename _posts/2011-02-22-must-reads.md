I don't know how long i've been using [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds for now but i know that i resisted it for a long time, instead continuing  to open a group of bookmarked &#8220;regulars&#8221; everyday. What a silly sausage. A day or two using Google Reader and i was convinced of RSS' merits. Nowadays, with a feed reader on my phone ([NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/iphone/)) i find i rarely visit the lovingly designed pages of my favourite sites, instead just digesting the constantly updated raw content.

The problem now though is that i often struggle to keep up with all of the feeds to which i'm subscribed. Leave it longer than 24 hours and it wouldn't surprise me to find 500+ new articles waiting to be read. Slacker that i am, not even i have time to wade through such a backlog. Mark As Read is my friend.

That said, there are _some_ feeds that i will always read through, no matter how high the unread figure is. And that's the point of this post, I just wanted to highlight a few feeds that i consider _Must Reads_.

**Atlas Obscura** &#8211; The Atlas describes itself as &#8220;a compendium of this age's wonders, curiosities, and esoterica&#8221; which is a nice way of saying that it's a good place to find out about some of the weird and wonderful stuff in the world.

**Daring Fireball** &#8211; Possibly one of the most influential sites in the Apple websphere. Some call John Gruber the king of the Apple fanboys &#8211; which may or may not be true &#8211; I just love to read it for the cynical take on technological happenings (usually Apple-related).

**Engadget** &#8211; One of the best sites for consumer technology news. And they seem to be loved by tech companies so often break news and have exclusive hands-on previews.

**MacRumors** &#8211; There are plenty of Apple rumour and news sites around but these guys offer a decent round-up of the latest goings-on.

**Neatorama** &#8211; It's like the highlights of the web and pop-culture in one place. (I should also mention [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/) &#8211; it offers much the same sort of content but it's quite heavy on political stuff which often puts me off)

**The Register** &#8211; The technology news tabloid. Almost certainly the best tech news offering written from a British point of view.
