Have you seen [Paperman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTLySbGoMX0), the short that Disney made to partner with feature film Wreck It Ralph? No? Oh, it&#8217;s superb. See for yourself&#8230;

Fantastic, i&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree. A fantastic, unique mix of 2D and 3D, hand-drawn frames and CG. Yeah? Yeah. I saw it, enjoyed it and closed the browser tab. Done. It was only after watching the film again with my 4 year old son and him insisting on watching something else that i discovered the [video below](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZJLtujW6FY). It features Paperman&#8217;s director, John Kahrs, telling us about the look and style and techniques used. I found it fascinating. The software they&#8217;ve created to achieve the Paperman look appears to be _incredible_.
