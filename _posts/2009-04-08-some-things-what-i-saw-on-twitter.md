I've not been using twitter for long, but it has already taught me several things&#8230;

[Disney Templates](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1906578) &#8211; Disney artists aren't afraid of borrowing their colleagues work. (via [Phil Jupitus](http://twitter.com/jupitusphillip))

[Cake Wrecks](http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/) &#8211; It's difficult to ice a cake well, even for &#8220;professionals&#8221;. [This](http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/2009/01/problem-with-phone-orders.html) being a particularly fine example. (via [Peter Serafinowicz](http://twitter.com/serafinowicz))

[Twistori](http://twistori.com) &#8211; Twitter can spawn some wonderful things. (via a link in the twitter sidebar)
