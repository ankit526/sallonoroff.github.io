I&#8217;ve not been using twitter for long, but it&#8217;s already taught me several things&#8230;

[Disney Templates](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1906578) &#8211; Disney artists aren&#8217;t afraid of borrowing their colleagues work. (via [Phil Jupitus](http://twitter.com/jupitusphillip))

[Cake Wrecks](http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/) &#8211; It&#8217;s difficult to ice a cake well, even for &#8220;professionals&#8221;. [This](http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/2009/01/problem-with-phone-orders.html) being a particularly fine example. (via [Peter Serafinowicz](http://twitter.com/serafinowicz))
