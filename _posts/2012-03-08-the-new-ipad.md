Yesterday [Apple unveiled the new iPad](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/07Apple-Launches-New-iPad.html).

Just &#8220;the new iPad&#8221;. Not the iPad 3, iPad HD, iPad 2S, iPad 2R or iPad Pro. I am pleased to see the numbering thing dropped. Presumably we will see the same thing happen to the iPhone line later this year.

The new iPad has some new [features](http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/) that had been predicted by rumour sites (Well done, rumour sites). It is also &#8220;missing&#8221; some new features that had been predicted by rumour sites (Well done, rumour sites).

The one surprise for me was the inclusion of 4G/LTE mobile networking. As far as i&#8217;m aware these services barely exist outside North America and are hardly ubiquitous within the US, so i thought Apple would hold off for another year.  Maybe they&#8217;ve conquered the battery-drain problems common with such high-speed mobile connections and just wanted to show the Android folk it could be done.

Perhaps the most exciting announcement made at yesterday&#8217;s press event though was that [iPhoto is coming to the iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/apps-by-apple/iphoto.html). It looks very, very good. So good in fact that i&#8217;m left wondering if my current Mac will be my last. It is clear that the future of mass-market &#8220;computing&#8221; is the iPad (other tablets are available) but i honestly wasn&#8217;t expecting it to happen as quickly as it appears to be.

Since email, web, video chat, word processing, spreadsheets, music and now photo management/editing are handled by apps on iOS devices, i&#8217;m struggling to think of a good reason i need a Personal Computer (in the old sense of the word) anymore. Right now, i only have one &#8211; and that&#8217;s storage capacity.
