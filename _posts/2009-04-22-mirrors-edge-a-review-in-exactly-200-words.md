Imagine the jumpy, ledge-grabby bits of Tomb Raider or the jumpy, ledge-grabby bits of Assassin&#8217;s Creed played in first-person and you pretty much have [Mirror&#8217;s Edge](http://www.mirrorsedge.com/). It&#8217;s essentially a game of &#8220;[free running](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning)&#8220;. I won&#8217;t bother describing the story as it&#8217;s pretty atrocious &#8211; much like the 2d-cartoon cut-scenes in which it is played out &#8211; suffice to say that in the near-future portrayed, postmen jump about rooftops.

You run from A to B with objects (boxes, drainpipes, etc) along the way coloured red to indicate some usefulness to your progression. This hand-holding is good except that you&#8217;re completely lost without it. And even when you can visualise what you need to do to get somewhere, it&#8217;s often incredibly difficult to actually do it. Thus the game is one of the most frustrating and infuriating games i&#8217;ve ever played, with some vaults literally taking 50 attempts or more. That being the case i was surprised to finish the story-mode so quickly (under eight hours &#8211; I reckon a decent gamer could do it in well under five).

Would i recommend this game? Well, as it&#8217;s a bit novel, yes. Just don&#8217;t buy it. Borrow or rent it. Or if your parkour&#8217;s any good, steal it.
