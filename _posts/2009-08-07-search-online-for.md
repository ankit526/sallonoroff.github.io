Ah, the humble HyperLink. The URL. The Web Address. Call it what you will, it's a modern day marvel. A simple string of characters that point you to something or other. Something or other that you're interested in, be that a webpage, a photo, a video, a song, a piece of software, whatever. Oh, and that little ol' URL doesn't just point you in the right direction &#8211; this thing is an address &#8211; it points you exactly at what you wanted. So why then do i keep seeing adverts which suggest that i &#8220;search online for&#8230;&#8221; the product/service name? What's the bloody matter with these marketeers? Rather than including an address on their advert that _will_ take the potential customer directly to _whatever they want them to see_, they instead suggest searching the web for some choice word or phrase that _may_ take them where they intended eventually. That same potential customer _may_ actually come across things the advertiser doesn't want them to see, such as a competitor's website or a bad review of the product or service in question. Worse still, there's always the chance they'll never find what they were meant-to at all.

If a company can afford avertising then they can certainly afford a decent, memorable domain name (even, much as i hate them, one especially crafted for a particularly ad campaign). I see zero need for the extra costs of _trying_ to ensure that your site is listed at the top of the results page for every search engine, when in fact you can never _guarantee_ it, however good your &#8220;SEO&#8221; experts think they are.

I had thought there would be lots of discussion of this topic on the web but was able to find surprisingly little. There were just a couple of blog entries, [here](http://www.fabricoffolly.com/2009/05/search-online-for-return-of-keywords-in.html) and [here](http://tamlyn.org/2008/08/search-terms-instead-of-urls/) ([twice](http://tamlyn.org/2009/01/more-search-terms-instead-of-urls/)) and these both, disappointingly, seem quite happy with the trend. The latter is particularly dismissive of URLS, insisting they're &#8220;difficult to remember and poorly understood&#8221;. Maybe i'm a proper trainspotter when it comes to URLs then? I do hope not. It's not that hard, is it?

To the layman, the URL is easily broken down into three parts: the _doubleyou-doubleyou-doubleyou-dot_, a brand or slogan and _the end bit_. Four parts if there's a _slash something_ on the end_._ And no more, since no sensible marketeer would start going down into sub-directories. So, just four (4) things for Joe Public to remember. Piece of piss, even for a true imbecile, since the typical Human brain  can remember 7 things (that's why telephone numbers are never more than 7 digits long). Plus, WWW is now practically a given, so ordinarily you only need remember 2-3 things: the _brand or slogan_ (domainname), _the end bit_ (TLD) and possibly a _slash something_ (directory).

apple.com/macbook  =  (**apple**) + (**.com**) + (**/macbook**)

o2.co.uk/iphone = (**o2**) + (**.co.uk**) + (**/iphone**)

Again, is that really so difficult?

I know i'd _always_ rather be given the phone number than be told to search the phone book.
