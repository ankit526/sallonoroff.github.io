Long-time visitors to this site may recall me mentioning the idea of a remote viewfinder for a camera [once](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/secondary-display-on-a-camera/) or [twice](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2011/06/the-wireless-viewfinder/) before. It&#8217;s a concept i was convinced had legs and one we&#8217;d see become reality before long. Well, now* it is a reality &#8211; though admittedly not in exactly the way i&#8217;d envisaged.

[The Register has a review](http://www.reghardware.com/2011/08/26/review_samsung_sh100_compact_camera/) of the Samsung SH100, a 14megapixel point-and-shoot digital camera that through the use of inbuilt wifi allows you, amongst other things, to take pictures remotely using your Samsung Android smartphone. Not quite the detachable-screen system that i&#8217;d formulated but it achieves the same thing. El Reg&#8217;s review only touches on this remote capture capability to say that it works ok but to me it nevertheless appears rather impressive. This is definitely some tech i&#8217;d like to try out in person.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if this sort of technology becomes ubiquitous in world of photography. I like to imagine it will.
