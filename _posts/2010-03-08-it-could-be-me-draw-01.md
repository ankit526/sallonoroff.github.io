The [Lotto](http://www.national-lottery.co.uk/player/p/lotterydrawgames/lotto.ftl) draw for Saturday 6th March 2010 marked the beginning of my &#8220;[It could be me](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2010/03/it-could-be-me/)&#8221; experiment. Maybe you read about it in the papers? No? Oh, i can&#8217;t believe they didn&#8217;t pick up on it. Oh well, maybe later on. So, how did I do? Are you now reading the ramblings of a millionaire?

Numbers drawn: ******6**, **13**, **27**, **28**, **34**, **42** + bonus ball **43**

My Numbers: ******6**, ******9**, **16**, **23**, **27**, **32**

No. of matching numbers: **2**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Meanwhile, in an online savings account sits one pound coin. Shiny, unmolested and (very) slowly earning interest.

All of which means that the non-lottery option is winning comprehensively so far&#8230;
