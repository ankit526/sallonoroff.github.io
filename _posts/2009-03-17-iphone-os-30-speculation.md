There&#8217;s plenty of [rumour](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/03/13/iphone-3-0-to-get-mms-tethering-and-finally-copy-and-paste/) and [speculation](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/03/16/iphone-3-0-rumors-and-possibilities-live-event-today/) about what updates to the iPhone Apple will announce today in their [live preview event](http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/12/iphone-os-3-0-is-coming-march-17th/), but about the most sensible take i&#8217;ve read on these rumours is [fryke&#8217;s](http://haligon.blogspot.com/2009/03/iphone-platform.html). I&#8217;d tend to agree with all his points, with the exception being about MMS:

> _&#8220;People who were using MMS extensively before going iPhone \_are\_ missing the feature. But it really \_is\_ just an expensive (at least in some places) replacement for real E-Mail. The iPhone does E-Mail really well. Adding MMS would basically mean to invest development hours into a vanishing technology. So I&#8217;m saying: No need, really. iPhone apps allow you to use Facebook and other platforms to share your pix online. If your contacts only have older phones that \_don&#8217;t\_ do Facebook and/or E-Mail well, they should get a better phone. May I suggest an iPhone?&#8221;_

Plenty of my &#8220;contacts&#8221; aren&#8217;t geeks&#8230; so while they might use email, they certainly don&#8217;t do so on their phone. Even if their phone handset is capable of it. MMS, however, is something that almost all my contacts have immediate access to (who doesn&#8217;t carry their mobile with them?) &#8211; and almost all of them can use it because it&#8217;s as simple as SMS. It&#8217;s clear that MMS hasn&#8217;t had the same impact as SMS but i&#8217;d hardly call it a vanishing technology. I guess we&#8217;ll see tonight where Apple stands on the matter.

I&#8217;m not an iPhone user so don&#8217;t have a list of gripes i&#8217;d want fixed by 3.0 but there are definitely some (perceived) problems that prevent this _potential customer_ from becoming a _customer_.
