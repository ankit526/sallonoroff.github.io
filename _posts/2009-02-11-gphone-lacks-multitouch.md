[John Gruber at DaringFireball seconds](http://daringfireball.net/2009/02/apple_google_palm) a [fascinating report](http://venturebeat.com/2009/02/09/apple-asked-google-not-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-and-google-complied/) that the GooglePhone, the G1, lacks multi-touch support because Apple asked/told/ordered/warned them not to. It also appears that Google are relieved to have complied given the patents-spat that may well kick off between Apple and Palm over the yet-to-be-released [Palm Pre](http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/).

I assume then that Google are simply waiting to see how the Apple-vs-Palm thing transpires before they flick the switch in Android to support multi-touch input&#8230;
