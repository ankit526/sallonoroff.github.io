[The Register is today reporting](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/apple_remote_patent/) on a patent application by Apple for a &#8220;3D Remote Controller&#8221;, presumably intended for use with the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/uk/appletv/). It appears to be a Wii-Remote-esque device, capable of, well, Wii-Remote-esque things. It is very interesting to see that Apple is at least pondering over this sort of interface but there's nothing all that ground-breaking to tell really. However, one aspect of the patent application is very, very curious &#8211; this remote can be used as a &#8220;torch&#8221; on the screen:

The screen greys-out or dims and &#8220;light&#8221; from the &#8220;torch&#8221; illuminates whichever part of the screen you're pointing it at. It's a very cool geeky thing to be able to do but what's the practical purpose? Is there one? I'm struggling. The best i can offer is that you'd be able to easily point something of interest out during a film or tv show&#8230; sort of how football pundits on TV are able to &#8220;draw&#8221; on footage to highlight their point about Frank Lampard (for example) being a useless waste of space.

Even more bizarrely though, the inverse of this torch function is mentioned in the application. So the screen stays lit _except_ for the spot where you're aiming the torch. What's that all about? It was difficult enough to see a use for a virtual on-screen torch! I'm really struggling here&#8230; Hmmm&#8230; Maybe it's for the sort of parents who think film censors aren't thorough enough?
