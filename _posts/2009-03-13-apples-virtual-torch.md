[The Register is today reporting](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/apple_remote_patent/) on a patent application by Apple for a &#8220;3D Remote Controller&#8221;, presumably intended for use with the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/uk/appletv/). It appears to be a Wii-Remote-esque device, capable of, well, Wii-Remote-esque things. It is very interesting to see that Apple is at least pondering over this sort of interface but there&#8217;s nothing all that ground-breaking to tell really. However, one aspect of the patent application is very, very curious &#8211; this remote can be used as a &#8220;torch&#8221; on the screen:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350" title="apple_virtual_torch" src="/images/fromwp/2009/03/apple_virtual_torch.jpg" alt="apple_virtual_torch" width="421" height="360" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/03/apple_virtual_torch.jpg 421w, /images/fromwp/2009/03/apple_virtual_torch-300x256.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" />

The screen greys-out or dims and &#8220;light&#8221; from the &#8220;torch&#8221; illuminates whichever part of the screen you&#8217;re pointing it at. It&#8217;s a very cool geeky thing to be able to do but what&#8217;s the practical purpose? Is there one? I&#8217;m struggling. The best i can offer is that you&#8217;d be able to easily point something of interest out during a film or tv show&#8230; sort of how football pundits on TV are able to &#8220;draw&#8221; on footage to highlight their point about Frank Lampard (for example) being a useless waste of space.

Even more bizarrelly though, the inverse of this torch function is mentioned in the application. So the screen stays lit _except_ for the spot where you&#8217;re aiming the torch. What&#8217;s that all about? It was difficult enough to see a use for a virtual on-screen torch! I&#8217;m really struggling here&#8230; Hmmm&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s for the sort of parents who think film censors aren&#8217;t thorough enough?
