My sister is thinking of buying an iPhone. She mentioned this to me the other day and remarked how expensive they were. If i&#8217;m honest, i wasn&#8217;t really paying much attention &#8211; until she said something about the phone being over £300 on several of O2&#8217;s tariffs. This struck me as odd, as i recalled when i was shopping around at iPhone 4 launch time there being only 1  tariff option that meant paying £300+ for the handset. Curious, I brought up the [Pay Monthly tariffs on O2&#8217;s website](http://shop.o2.co.uk/new-iphone/tariffs.html) and, sure enough, the handset prices were all more expensive than i remembered them being.

My first thought was VAT. The VAT rate in Britain rose from 17.5% to 20% in January. That must be it&#8230; Except, no, upon examination, some of these prices are more &#8211; way more, in fact &#8211; than the 2.5% increase in tax would have made them.

At this point i wondered if it was just an O2 price hike, so i dug out my price list from June 2010 and checked the current [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.co.uk/brands/iphone/pay-monthly-iphone/index.htm) and [Orange](http://shop.orange.co.uk/iphone/choose-your-4g-plan) prices against it too. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the launch-time prices versus the current prices (and also what the prices should&#8217;ve been if it was just down to the VAT rise)&#8230;

  Orange, it seems, have been quite fair to consumers &#8211; they&#8217;ve just stuck 99 pence onto most handset prices and are therefore actually a little out of pocket taken against the VAT rise. It is a different story with O2 and Vodafone though. Customers buying an iPhone 4 from O2 are now paying upto £20 more for the 16GB model and upto £30 more for the 32GB model. Those consumers choosing the Vodafone network are in some instances paying over £45 more than those who bought the same phone 9 months ago. Adding insult to injury, Orange and Vodafone have reduced the mobile data allowance on many tariffs, so as well as paying more for a 9 month old handset some new customers will be getting less for the monthly price they pay too.

So, it appears mobile operators are charging more for the iPhone 4 now than 9 months ago when it was a brand-spanking-new piece of technology. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this per se &#8211; we live in a capitalist world after all and companies can charge what they like for products &#8211; but when was the last time you saw a mobile telephone have a higher price-tag 9 months after release? They&#8217;re usually being given away free by that point. Furthermore, Apple haven&#8217;t raised the price of the contract-free iPhone 4 (save for the VAT rise &#8211; 16GB was £499 now £510, 32GB was £599 now £612) so why have the telcos?

I&#8217;ve advised my sister to hold off purchasing a new phone until summer. Even if she doesn&#8217;t get an &#8220;iPhone 5&#8221;, the price of an iPhone 4 should be much, much lower.

**Update:** A clever twitter follower has [pointed out](https://twitter.com/fernando_jnr/status/51312674734219264) that the reason for the price rise might be so they can later claim to have &#8220;discounted&#8221; the iPhone 4. It makes sense and is slightly less dastardly than the reason being simply &#8220;because they can&#8221;.
