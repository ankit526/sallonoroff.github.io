I'm a bit behind with these ICBM updates, so forgive (be thankful) for the lack of witty, insightful summary&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **16, 19, 26, 27, 41, 47** + bonus ball **34**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **0**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Still nothing won on the lottery but the bank account continues to accrue the interest&#8230; albeit a penny at a time.

**Lottery balance: £-27  |  Not A Lottery balance: £27.04**
