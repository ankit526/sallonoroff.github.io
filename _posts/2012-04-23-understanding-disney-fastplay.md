If you've bought any Disney DVDs recently you may have come across &#8211; and perhaps been a little confused by &#8211; the new FastPlay feature. Disney's 12-point FAQs about FastPlay can be found [here](http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/fastplay/faq.html). Alternatively, here's a simpler explanation:

If you use FastPlay, you get to watch all the ads and the movie without a troublesome menu getting in the way.

If you skip FastPlay, you get to the main menu without any ads and can play the movie straight away.

I know which I prefer.
