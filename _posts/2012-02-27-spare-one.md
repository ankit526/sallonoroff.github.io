So, here&#8217;s the [SpareOne](http://www.spareonephone.com/). A mobile phone powered by a single AA battery and &#8211; as the name suggests &#8211; intended to be kept as a spare.

It&#8217;s a novel idea, and a lovely bit of design, but i&#8217;m not convinced there&#8217;s very much point to it. Let&#8217;s take a look at the 4 &#8220;use cases&#8221; suggested by the makers.

1) _Daily Emergency Phone. Just in case. &#8220;I forgot my charger&#8221;_

Sure, makes sense. Only we&#8217;re heading towards a world of standardised mobile phone mains chargers. Also, car chargers are available. And spare batteries. And battery-boosters. And solar chargers. And sometimes you can find these quaint things called telephones in people&#8217;s houses or place of work. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re out in the wilds away from any sort of power source, then what are the chances of mobile coverage anyway?

2) _Travel Phone. Save roaming charges. &#8220;I am not paying those roaming charges&#8221;_

Um&#8230; how would this be any different than just sticking a local SIM in your own phone exactly?

3) _Family Safety. Peace of mind. &#8220;I hope the kids are safe&#8221;_

Yeah, i&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be no social stigma attached to being seen carrying one of these.

4) _Emergency Phone. Natural disaster. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find power anywhere&#8221;_

That AA battery might well last upto 15 years but i doubt the SIM card would still be active after such a period.

Snarking aside, i&#8217;m fairly sure the SpareOne will find itself a niche market. Probably related to that last use case &#8211; in the event of a true emergency. I can quite see them being included in First Aid packs or being distributed en masse in disaster zones.
