Apropos of nothing &#8211; though perhaps meaningful at some later date &#8211; aÂ powerful little snippet from "Country of the Blind" by [Christopher Brookmyre](http://www.brookmyre.co.uk/):

> _Disbelief was a reaction borne of so much wolf-crying, with the public so desensitised by the hyperbole with which the most tedious events were related (and the deceitful exaggeration with which the most harmless quote could be twisted or recontextualised to create &#8220;a sensation&#8221; where there was barely a story), that when something truly remarkable happened, you just couldn't deal with it. The media, having robbed every superlative of its meaning through misuse and over-use, did not have a vocabulary with which to convey such import. Once you've used up all your language of astonishment on Hugh Grant getting his cock sucked, how do you express the shock of thirty schoolchildren being gunned down in a gym hall...?_
