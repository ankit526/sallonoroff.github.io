For years and years I really liked Google. They gave me great online tools and services for free, built astounding things that helped us all and, perhaps most importantly, just seemed like a _nice_ company. As much as a commercial entity can, at least. Yes, there was the whole mining-information-about-me thing but hey! they&#8217;re nice folks, they&#8217;re not going to do anything shady with it.

So what has changed? Very little, i guess. They still provide great online tools and services, these are still (mostly) free and Google continues to build astounding things that help us all. It&#8217;s just that my opinion of them has shifted. Despite [their motto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil), to me Google no longer seems like a nice company. I can&#8217;t pinpoint one thing that caused this change, rather it has been a gradual process &#8211; an accumulation of niggles and doubts. And i think Google&#8217;s [recent decision to shutdown Google Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html)Â (which they&#8217;d made the de facto RSS service, having destroying all the competition with a great, free product) was the catalyst i needed to finally make some changes.

Beginning today i&#8217;m going to try* to stop being [Google&#8217;s product](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/06/elgan-google-product).

This blog (and various other pages at sallonoroff.co.uk) no longer uses Analytics. And it no longer makes use of FeedBurner**. I&#8217;m in the process of ditching Reader before it vanishes on 1st July, I&#8217;ve already migrated the one remaining Google Calendar i still used and i will, once i figure out how, be removing myself from google+. Chrome too will lose out to Safari and/or Firefox. Lastly &#8211; and this is the biggy for me &#8211; having managed to download a local copy of all my messages, i&#8217;ll also no longer be using Gmail for my personal email.

Will Google care? No, of course not. They&#8217;ll not notice. But then fortunately i don&#8217;t think i will either.

* Yes, i admit it, i will probably continue googling with Google. As much as i&#8217;d like to go elsewhere, nothing comes close to Google&#8217;s search. Sorry, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

** Apologies to the handful of people reading this blog using Feedburner&#8217;s email subscription function. The RSS feed should re-direct but as far as i can tell i&#8217;ve no replacement for email.
