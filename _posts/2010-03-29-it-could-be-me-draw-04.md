I think you know the score by now. Also, that i'm here writing this means i've not won anything.

Numbers drawn: **06, 11, 15, 32, 38, 42** + bonus ball **24**

My Numbers: **6, 9, 16, 23, 27, 32**

No. of matching numbers: **2**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

4 attempts, 4 losses. The bank balance maintains its lead&#8230;

**Lottery balance: £-4  |  Not A Lottery balance: £4**

**Note:** For those of you that are following my progress closely, you'll have noted that i have played the same numbers each week thus far. Why so? Well, for 2 very silly reasons:

1) The idea of &#8220;luck&#8221;. I assume most gamblers, even if not serious, will apportion at least some of their success/failure to Lady Luck. This being the case, i chose to play the only numbers that have ever won me something on the National Lottery. Yes, once upon a time the line 06, 09, 16, 23, 27, 32 bagged me £10.

2) &#8220;Sod's law&#8221;. Having now played the same numbers more than once i have fallen into a superstitious trap. That is to say, if i choose not to play these numbers one week, by the law of the sod, they will be the numbers drawn at National Lottery HQ.

I can clearly see that these are irrational beliefs but, for the time being at least, i'm compelled to abide by them.
