I grew up in the Eighties. I think my first exposure to a computer was &#8211; probably like many people my age &#8211; a [BBC Micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro)Â at school. But that wasn't the computer i used most as a child. No, while everyone else played with their Spectrums, Commodores and Ataris, our home computer was one my peers had never heard of &#8211; a [Dragon 32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64).

The Dragon's 30th anniversary was last year and i've just found this lovely piece on [the history of the machine's development at the Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/01/the_dragon_32_is_30_years_old/). It's nice to learn that the Dragon 32 was more popular than i thought possible growing up.

And now i'm kind of itching for a game of Cuthbert in the Cooler.
