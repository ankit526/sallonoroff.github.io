Are you a novice computer user? Would you like to annoy those friends, family members and colleagues that are &#8220;better&#8221; than you &#8220;at computers&#8221;? Here are 5 quite innocent techniques guaranteed to wind them up should you ever find yourselves sat together at a computer&#8230;

1. Delete large bodies of text by tapping backspace to delete each character individually.

2. Use Caps Lock to type a single character in uppercase.

3. Double-click all hyperlinks.

4. Switch between text entry fields by taking your hand from the keyboard to make use of the mouse.

5. Make liberal use of the Comic Sans typeface in your work.

See? Easy-peasy! With a little stubbornness and determination you could give your chosen victim a brain aneurysm in no time at all.
