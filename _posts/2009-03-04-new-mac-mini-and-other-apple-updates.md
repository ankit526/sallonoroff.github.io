Apple <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">today</span> yesterday, as expected, announced a revised [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/uk/macmini/) &#8211; and it seems last month&#8217;s [leaked photo and video](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/new-mac-mini/) were 100% legit. It _does_ exist, it _does_ have two video outputs and it _does_ have five USB ports. In fact the only details from the leak that you could claim were incorrect was that it&#8217;d come with 2GB RAM. That is true of the &#8220;high end&#8221; model but it turns out the lower-end model only sports 1GB. That&#8217;s not so much incorrect as incomplete really though. 1GB _is_ a bit of a surprise to me &#8211; i truly assumed 2GB was going to be the new base RAM level for the Apple range. The five USB ports and two video ports are very pleasant surprises &#8211; maybe Apple is becoming a little more flexible with age? Or maybe they&#8217;re just being flexible to tempt some more Switchers across to the Mac?

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Today&#8217;s</span> Yesterday&#8217;s announcement also saw updates to the [iMac](http://www.apple.com/uk/imac), [Mac Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macpro), [AirPort Extreme](http://www.apple.com/uk/airportextreme/) unit and [Time Capsule](http://www.apple.com/uk/timecapsule) device. The Macintosh updates were reasonably substantial internally (new chips, new graphics, more RAM, etc &#8211; now even the lowest-spec 24&#8243; iMac looks like a bit of a beast) but since nothing happened in terms of designs it wasn&#8217;t all that exciting. Likewise the only hardware change to the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule was the fitting of dual-band wifi card &#8211; so now you can simultaneously have 11b/g and 11n networks broadcast from the one unit. That said, Apple did also add a new software feature to these devices so that you can now create a &#8220;guest&#8221; wifi signal which is totally independent of your own network.

About the most interesting thing that&#8217;s happened <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">today</span> yesterday wasn&#8217;t even really announced. The most keen-eyed Apple-fanatics spotted very soon after the Store came back online that the wired Apple keyboard had lost it&#8217;s NumPad. Yep, the default wired keyboard is the same size as the wireless one. Worry not though, Apple haven&#8217;t completely lost their marbles (yet) &#8211; you can still get the _full_ wired keyboard as a free configure-to-order option. I hope the choice is permanent but you never know it could just be while stocks of the &#8220;old&#8221; &#8216;board last or maybe it&#8217;s a test to see how many people actually want/need a full keyboard? Whatever the reason, the keyboard section is now about the biggest in the &#8220;Customise your Mac&#8221; page&#8230;

Yes, i know you&#8217;ve already read all the above in a hundred other places by now but that&#8217;s what all the &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">today</span> yesterday&#8221; business in this post is about. I did actually have this piece ready very soon after the announcements were made&#8230; but got interrupted and never found time to publish it. It&#8217;s had to wait until now. Sorry.
