I guess by now you're likely to be familiar with John Lewis' Christmas TV ad, [The Bear and the Hare](http://www.johnlewis.com/inspiration-and-advice/az-of-christmas/bear-and-hare).

Just in case you aren't, here it is&#8230;

Whether you like or dislike the advert (or couldn't care less), I expect you assumed it was created with CG. Yes? Well, you'd be wrong. Rather incredibly, they've drawn those 2D characters and then animated them with stop-motion on a 3D set. An extremely lengthy and delicate operation requiring thousands of models but one which has yielded a beautiful result. I really admire this sort of work, even if it is just to help a big name retailer start hawking Christmas in November.

[Creative Review has the full story](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/november/behind-the-scenes-on-the-john-lewis-christmas-ad), which I fully recommend you giving over 10 minutes to.

**Update:** The [original John Lewis video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWig2WARb0) seems to have been made unavailable, so i've swapped the above embed for someone else's copy&#8230;
