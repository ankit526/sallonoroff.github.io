Right, so there are [rumours of touch-sensitive iPhone/iPod casing](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/13/next-generation-iphone-to-offer-touch-sensitive-casing/),Â [MacPredictions has a very interesting post](http://www.macpredictions.com/2010/01/introducing-all-new-islate-with-magic.html) on how a multi-touch case might work on a tablet device and [now there's talk of a touchscreen iMac](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2010/01/18/apple_touchscreen_imac/).

It's beginning to look like OSX's multi-touch functionality is going to put [Windows7's stuff](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/discover/touch) even further into the shade.
