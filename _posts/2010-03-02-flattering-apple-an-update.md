So, it turns out that the [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad) doesn't hail a change in design direction for Apple. That's a shame for 2 reasons:

1) I'd really, really like a clue as to what Apple's future kit will look like. There have been 3 versions of the iPhone now and they've all looked very similar. I'm anticipating a new look for the 4th incarnation, presumably coming out this summer.

2) Other manufacturers have been able to anticipate what the Apple tablet would look like&#8230;

Interesting to note that everyone has based their tablet around widescreen video, whereas Apple is pushing the iPad as a portrait-oriented device.
