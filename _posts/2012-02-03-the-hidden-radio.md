This gorgeous little thing is the [Hidden Radio](http://hiddenradiodesign.com/) by designersÂ John Van Den Nieuwenhuizen and Vitor Santa Maria. It&#8217;s a battery-powered FM/AM radio but you can also use it as a wireless speaker (via bluetooth) for your computer, phone, tablet, etc. And its simple aesthetic is matched by how easy it is to use too: Just twist the top portion to turn on and adjust the volume.

They&#8217;ve smashed the funding goal of $125,000 [on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2107726947/hidden-radio-and-bluetooth-speaker) with nearly a million dollars pledged thus far, so you should soon be able to get your hands on one.

PS. It kind of reminds me of the equally simple and equally beautiful [Sony TR-1825 radio](http://www.core77.com/blog/consumer_product/sexy_simple_sony_the_tr-1825_radio_21191.asp). (Now 40 years old, though you&#8217;d be forgiven for believing otherwise.)
