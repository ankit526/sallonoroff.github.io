RELEASE THE BALLS!

Numbers drawn: **08, 09, 19, 28, 31, 37** + bonus ball **45**

My Numbers: **6, 9, 16, 23, 27, 32**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

So, we're over a month into the experiment now and the bank option still leads. We would've had some interest added to the account this week too, had the balance (and/or interest rate) been higher.

**Lottery balance: £-5  |  Not A Lottery balance: £5**
