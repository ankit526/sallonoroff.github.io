Right, backlog cleared and we're bang up-to-date. Here's the outcome of ICBM draw number 30 (AKA National Lottery Lotto draw 1540, 25th September 2010)&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **19, 22, 30, 33, 35, 39** + bonus ball **05**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Well, this brings an end to a 4-draw streak of matching no numbers whatsoever&#8230; which is something i suppose but still doesn't bag me any winnings.

**Lottery balance: £-30  //  Not A Lottery balance: £30.04**
