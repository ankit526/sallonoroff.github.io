So, a while ago i cracked this less-than-brilliant joke on twitter&#8230;

![That's how i roll.](/images/fromwp/2011/03/howiroll.jpg)

Obviously, at the time, i thought i was being marvellously original but then once i'd posted it i started seeing other versions of the gag being retweeted about twitter. It was fairly clear that these were not rip-offs but &#8220;original&#8221; tweets &#8211; written completely differently, but in essence exactly the same joke. Over time i got used to seeing it, pointing them out to no-one but myself&#8230; until one day i saw this:

It wasn't a stranger's joke being retweeted at me but, [@intruth](http://twitter.com/intruth/status/31020033647841280), someone i follow (and who follows me) making the gag. So i mentioned my version to him. Then [@thom_white](http://twitter.com/thom_white) piped up that he'd been trying to write something with the same punchline. Ever since then the 3 of us have been pointing out further examples to each other when we see them.

Here's the collection so far&#8230; (sadly, i never made a note of the 6 or 7 that i spotted before @intruth's and it's not really possible to search for these jokes since it turns out that the people of twitter use &#8220;that's how i roll&#8221; quite a lot.)
