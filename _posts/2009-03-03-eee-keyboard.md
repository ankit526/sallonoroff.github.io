Before i get distracted by new Mac Minis, iMacs and Mac Pros (which [look like](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/03/03/last-minute-specs-imac-mac-minis-airport-extreme-time-capsule-and-mac-pros/) being announced today), i just wanted to mention the ASUS&#8217; Eee Keyboard PC, which [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/03/hands-on-with-asus-eee-keyboard/) has had chance to play with at CeBIT.

Yes, that _is_ it. That keyboard is the PC. And a reasonably slim keyboard it is at that. I&#8217;m really quite impressed especially since they&#8217;ve managed to cram in an Intel Atom processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB solid-state drive, ethernet, .11n wireless, bluetooth, speakers, microphone, 2 USB ports, and both VGA and HDMI video outputs! Plus it has a 5-inch touchscreen. Basically, it&#8217;s got everything you&#8217;d expect from a PC but in a fraction of the space. I&#8217;ve always had a soft-spot for the tiny cases that can be created with mini-ITX and nano-ITX kit&#8230; but this is a particularly good example. And the Apple-esque slim, rounded keys are a nice addition too. I love it.
