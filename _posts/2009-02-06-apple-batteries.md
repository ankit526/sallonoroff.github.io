Clearly Apple isn&#8217;t adverse to fitting non-user-removable batteries in its devices (see iPod, iPhone, MacBook Air or new 17&#8243; MacBook Pro)&#8230; but thankfully it seems they are at least [toying with the idea of removable batteries](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/06/apple_battery_patents/). The patents discussed in the Reg&#8217;s article also mention inductive charging and swapping out the &#8220;battery chemicals&#8221;. Blimey.
