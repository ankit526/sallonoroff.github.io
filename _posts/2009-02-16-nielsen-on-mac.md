[Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/macintosh.html) (yes, he of usability fame) on 25 years of the Macintosh&#8230;

> _&#8220;The Mac's miserable marketplace performance seems to pose a strong argument against usability. Why bother, if it doesn't sell?_
> 
> _The counter-argument is that usability is the only reason Mac survived. Compared to the PC, it was much more expensive, had only a fraction of the specialized applications, and was cursed by Apple's business-hostile attitude._
> 
> _So why would anyone pay more for less? Because Macs were easier to use.&#8221;_
