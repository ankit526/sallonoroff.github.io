Until today i'd been using the [Portable Network Graphics (PNG)](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/) format for most of the images i include in this blog, as (being lossless) they look better than JPGs and GIFs. Sadly the price to pay for this image quality is a larger filesize &#8211; often much larger &#8211; even when compressing them using [PNGOUT](http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm), so i've decided to stick to JPGs from now on. The images might not look quite as good but i'm afraid the 70% reduction in filesize wins hands-down.
