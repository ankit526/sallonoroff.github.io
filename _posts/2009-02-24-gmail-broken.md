I&#8217;ve not been able to log into Gmail for about two and a half hours now. Which is nice.

A Google [Status Report](http://mail.google.com/support/) says:

> _&#8220;We&#8217;re aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a number of users. This problem occurred at approximately 1.30AM Pacific Time. We&#8217;re working hard to resolve this problem and will post updates as we have them. We apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused.&#8221;_

Presumably before it went through the PR-alizer, it read:

> _Something&#8217;s gone titsup on the Gmail systems meaning nobody can log-in. It&#8217;s happened in the middle of the night here in California so you&#8217;ll have to wait for a fix until we can find which cupboard the on-site engineer is sleeping in. Or until we can coax one of the on-call engineers out of bed. We regret that this has happened but you really shouldn&#8217;t be using a &#8220;beta&#8221; product if you wanted reliability, should you?_

Apologies for my __most typical-whingey-blogger post to date but since Gmail isn&#8217;t working i have nothing better to do&#8230;

**Update:** Yep, you guessed it &#8211; as soon as i clicked &#8220;Publish&#8221; on this post Gmail started working again. The law of sods.
