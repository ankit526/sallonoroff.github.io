I've not been able to log into Gmail for about two and a half hours now. Which is nice.

A Google [Status Report](http://mail.google.com/support/) says:

> _&#8220;We're aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a number of users. This problem occurred at approximately 1.30AM Pacific Time. We're working hard to resolve this problem and will post updates as we have them. We apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused.&#8221;_

Presumably before it went through the PR-alizer, it read:

> _Something's gone titsup on the Gmail systems meaning nobody can log-in. It's happened in the middle of the night here in California so you'll have to wait for a fix until we can find which cupboard the on-site engineer is sleeping in. Or until we can coax one of the on-call engineers out of bed. We regret that this has happened but you really shouldn't be using a &#8220;beta&#8221; product if you wanted reliability, should you?_

Apologies for my most typical-whingey-blogger post to date but since Gmail isn't working i have nothing better to do&#8230;

**Update:** Yep, you guessed it &#8211; as soon as i clicked &#8220;Publish&#8221; on this post Gmail started working again. The law of sods.
