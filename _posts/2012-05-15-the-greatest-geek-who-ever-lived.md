There's a rather wonderful new comic up [at The Oatmeal about Nikola Tesla](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla). If you're not familiar with Tesla's many achievements then please go learn something. If you already know about Tesla then go and read it anyway &#8211; remind yourself how insanely brilliant he was.
