A tip for those of you with broken or faulty external hard disks: Open them up and see if anything is salvageable!

If your external drive has stopped functioning, the chances are that either the disk has died _OR_ the controller board has fried. It's unlikely to be the case that they're both bust, so you may be about to throw away a perfectly good disk or the basis of a hard disk &#8220;caddy&#8221;.

I recently managed to catch a Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external drive just before it headed bin-wards. The owner said didn't work and had already chucked out the power adapter. After pulling it apart, i discovered that the original 320gb disk contained within was dead but found, once i had a suitable power supply (taken from a monitor, if you're interested), that the little controller board was fine.

So, a &#8220;broken&#8221; one of these&#8230;

Became this&#8230;

Like i said, ugly. But i now have an extra USB IDE hard disk caddy that cost me nothing but 15 minutes of my precious time.
