The outcome of Saturday&#8217;s lottery draw&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **13, 16, 22, 25, 31, 39** + bonus ball **07**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: ****

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

So the balances look something like this. Something like. I haven&#8217;t checked the bank account &#8211; it likely to have made another penny in interest since we&#8217;ve just started a new month.

**Lottery balance: £-23  //  Not A Lottery balance: £23.02**
