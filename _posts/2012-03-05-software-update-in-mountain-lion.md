Last year when [i wrote about the Mac App Store](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2011/05/on-the-mac-app-store/), i pondered about the future of OS X&#8217;s Software Update mechanism. Specifically, whether system updates would shift into the App Store, or if we&#8217;d be left with two separateÂ update systems.

From OS X 10.8 onwards, [it looks like being the former](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/16/software-update-to-move-inside-mac-app-store-in-os-x-mountain-lion/). Mr and Mrs Smith shall be pleased.
