After discovering that [decent headphones could be had for as little as Â£6](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2015/07/panasonic-rp-hje125-earphones/), I started wondering what the very cheapest headphones would sound like. And where I might source them. Amazon and eBay have plenty of tiny-budget offerings but if I wanted something truly dirt cheap I needed to eliminate postage costs. With this in mind, I set my sights on high street tat retailer&nbsp;[Poundland](http://www.poundland.co.uk)&nbsp;and the exciting low-cost wonders I might find dumped in&nbsp;their technology aisle&#8230; But I never got that far, instead spotting some &#8216;phones quite by chance&nbsp;in&nbsp;rival austerity bazaar&nbsp;[B&M](http://www.bmstores.co.uk/). Ninety-nine pence later I was the proud owner of some&nbsp;Maxell EB-95 (190560) earphones. Here&#8217;s a quick review.

If you were hoping for me to write anything positive about the EB-95s then let me start this with the only thing I have for you: they don&#8217;t immediately sound dreadful. Don&#8217;t misunderstand, they are bad, but you might not realise how bad if you&#8217;ve nothing to compare them with. Spoken word is actually listenable through these but any sort of music just sounds distant, washy and several other kinds of awful. No, I wouldn&#8217;t call myself an&nbsp;audiophile but I do know that audio-wise these earphones are sorely lacking in, well,&nbsp;everything.

Don&#8217;t worry too much about the poor sound quality though because you&#8217;ll probably not be able to use them anyway. Firstly, at about 90cm in length, the cord is&nbsp;far, far too short to really use the headphones in any practical, meaningful way. And secondly, even if you can deal with the short cord, the hard plastic rest-in-your-ear buds are painfully uncomfortable to wear for any&nbsp;more than about 10 minutes. A truly unpleasant experience.

In conclusion, if you&#8217;re absolutely desperate then I can confirm that Maxell&#8217;s EB-95s do work. But ultimately you might just be better off being that inconsiderate dick who plays music through his phone&#8217;s speaker in public.
