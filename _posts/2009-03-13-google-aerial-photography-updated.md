Noticed this earlier in the week but forgot to mention it here&#8230; Google have finally updated the aerial photography used in [Google Maps](http://maps.google.co.uk/). Or at least they have for South Yorkshire. Good to see the 6 or 7 year old imagery replaced with something that appears to have been collected in the last 6 months or so.

We&#8217;re still waiting on the Street View imagery though&#8230; ([Street View Spycars](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/15/google_spycar_map/) were definitely out and about in the UK last year).
