Hello there. We're now 9 weeks into this experiment and i'm boiling with a sense of entitlement to a win, such is the stupidity of this gambling lark.

Numbers drawn: **6, 15, 28, 29, 30, 47** + bonus ball **19**

My Numbers: **6, 9, 16, 23, 27, 32**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

And so the two balances now look like this&#8230;

**Lottery balance: £-9  |  Not A Lottery balance: £9**
