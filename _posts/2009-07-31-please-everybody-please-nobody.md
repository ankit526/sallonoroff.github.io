I recently had cause to unbox and setup a Toshiba Tecra M10-17H laptop. I expect, like me before this experience, you're unfamiliar with this machine and are wondering why the hell this is going to be of any interest. And rightly so &#8211; it isn't a computer the world, as far as i know, is rushing out to buy. But it is certainly a curious bit of kit. Let me explain.

The &#8220;computer&#8221; spec of the thing is all as you'd expect (Core2Such-and-such, X GB of RAM, X^10 GB hard disk capacity, etc) and  it has all the I/O interfaces in all the quantities you might expect on a modern laptop &#8211; three USB2 ports, a VGA video output, a DVD writer, an ethernet port and So-Many-in-1 cardreader. However, the number of other things included just smacked of desperation &#8211; desperation to please _everybody_.

The most immediately obvious example of this is the &#8220;dual pointing device&#8221;. That is to say, the laptop includes the traditional touchpad you'd expect to find but also the IBM-style nipple-in-keyboard system&#8230;

This just strikes me as nutty. Trackpads have long been the &#8220;standard&#8221; Mouse for laptops, so why bother including the old IBM ThinkPad nipple setup too? Either there's a market for devices with the Nipple or there isn't &#8211; so make a Tecra with a Nipple, or don't bother. Don't complicate things and compromise by including &#8220;dual pointing devices&#8221;.

There's more evidence that this machine was put together with a &#8220;lets try and please everbody&#8221; attitude though. In addition to all the I/O listed before, this laptop also sports an iLink port (AKA firewire), an eSata port, a slot for a PC Card, a &#8220;Smartcard&#8221; slot, a 56K modem and Serial port(!). Can anyone think of any base this thing hasn't got covered?

So, what's the price to pay for all this &#8220;functionality&#8221; and &#8220;compatibility&#8221;? Well, apart from the £950 hit on your bank account balance, it has looks only a mother could love. And a weight only a mother could bear to carry around. It is truly a brick. Albeit one with everything you could ever need.

Actually, thinking about it, i've just realised who might have &#8220;designed&#8221; the Tecra M10-17H&#8230; Well, he does have form&#8230;
