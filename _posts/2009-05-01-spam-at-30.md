No, not [SPiced hAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)) (that's nearly 72 years old) but [the shite we get in our email inboxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)) everyday turns 30 today. Well, that's what the [Metro claimed](http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/04/the-art-of-spam-canadian-pharmacy-top-prices.html) this morning anyway. I'd suggest it's very difficult to put such an exact date on the birth of unsolicited junk email but there you go. Point is, it's knocking on a bit but showing no sign of kindly fucking off. Fortunately it does have its merits. The Metro's piece points out some of the art that has been created from spam (i particular like [this work](http://www.flickr.com/photos/linzie/sets/72157602417089145/)) but at a more basic level it is often possible to delight in the [subjects](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Genuinespamsubjectlineoftheday) or [sender names](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=spam+names) used by these messages.

Oh, and very occasionally, the message itself throws up some hysterical surprises&#8230;
