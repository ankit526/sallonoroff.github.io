No, not [SPiced hAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)) (that&#8217;s nearly 72 years old) but [the shite we get in our email inboxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)) everyday turns 30 today. Well, that&#8217;s what the [Metro claimed](http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/04/the-art-of-spam-canadian-pharmacy-top-prices.html) this morning anyway. I&#8217;d suggest it&#8217;s very difficult to put such an exact date on the birth of unsolicited junk email but there you go. Point is, it&#8217;s knocking on a bit but showing no sign of kindly fucking off. Fortunately it does have its merits. The Metro&#8217;s piece points out some of the art that has been created from spam (i particular like [this work](http://www.flickr.com/photos/linzie/sets/72157602417089145/)) but at a more basic level it is often possible to delight in the [subjects](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Genuinespamsubjectlineoftheday) or [sender names](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=spam+names) used by these messages.

Oh, and very occasionally, the message itself throws up some hysterical surprises&#8230;
