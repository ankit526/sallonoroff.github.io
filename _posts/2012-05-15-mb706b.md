This talk of electrics and plugs has reminded me to post about what is probably my favourite Apple accessory design &#8211; and possibly one of my favourite Apple hardware designs, full-stop &#8211; the humble Apple USB Power Adapter. Yep, that&#8217;s the [MB706B](http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MB706B/B)Â that is supplied with all UK-bound iPhones.

Look at it. Just look at it. So beautiful. Utter simplicity. And yet you know that an unusually high amount of work has gone into making it that way. There aren&#8217;t many companies in the world that would put so much time and effort into creating a mobile phone accessory.

Or, as Sir Jonathan puts it:

> _So much of what we try to do is get to a point where the solution seems inevitable: you know, you think &#8220;of course it&#8217;s that way, why would it be any other way?&#8221; It looks so obvious, but that sense of inevitability in the solution is really hard to achieve._
