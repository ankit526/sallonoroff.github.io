Another set of results, as perfunctory as a man&#8217;s sexual activity in the shower:

Numbers drawn: **01, 16, 17, 19, 33, 34** + bonus ball **09**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1 + bonus ball**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Fifteen goes. FIFTEEN. And nothing.  Not a single bean from the lottery. And yet still my sense of expectancy is not diminished, even though the other day i noticed the chances of winning a tenner are just 1 in 56 &#8211; so i&#8217;m not likely to win anything at all in my year long (52 weeks, kids!) experiment.

**Lottery balance: £-15  //  Not A Lottery balance: £15.01**
