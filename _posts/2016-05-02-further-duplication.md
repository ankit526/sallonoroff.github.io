I've no further insight into why this happens, but here's another example of [the same idea being independently germinated at around the same time](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2013/10/on-ideas/).

Compare and contrast: [Qubic Modular Power System](http://www.gadgette.com/2016/03/31/qubic-makes-us-wish-all-power-strips-were-modular/) and [YOUMO Smart Modular Power Strip](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1300499319/youmo-your-smart-modular-power-strip)

Curious. I like both, by the way. And that the YOUMO raised â‚¬177,000 on Kickstarter against a 50K target suggests this sort of thing should have been made years ago. (It definitely should.)

PS. Funnily enough, I also came across [this Kickstarter for &#8220;Splyt Light&#8221;](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1244118214/splyt-light), which instantly reminded me of [Peter Larkam&#8217;s Branch](http://www.peterlarkamdesign.com/branch/) (touched upon in that original &#8220;[On ideas](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2013/10/on-ideas/)&#8221; post), only it's a bit more practical and far less pretty.

PPS. I just noticed that since the Branch lighting system, Peter Larkam has had a go at designing a [modular smartphone](http://www.peterlarkamdesign.com/smartphone/) and that bears more than a passing resemblance to [the Click concept](/images/fromwp/2013/09/CLICK-scan-900x615.jpg) produced by his former classmate Oliver Rooker. Plagiarism or inspiration? Intentional or unconscious? The only thing I'm certain of any more is this topic opening many cans of worms.
