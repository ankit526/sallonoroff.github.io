There's a slightly alarming [article at The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/06/mobileme_censorware_row/) suggesting that Apple are &#8220;filtering&#8221; outbound MobileMe mail&#8230;

> _Reg reader Mike Conley, who was the first to tell us of the problem, said that one of three offending messages he sent was blocked because it mentioned the phrase &#8220;growing hostility against Frankfurt and Brussels&#8221;. An email about civil unrest in Greece about the sovereign debt crisis/austerity budget was also dropped. Conley realised there was a problem because he sends messages to himself via bcc. He complained and one of the offending messages was transmitted only for the problem to reappear days later._

I really, really hope that this is unintentional.
