I&#8217;ve been beaten to creating the [LED lightbulb](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/led-lightbulbs/), a decent set ofÂ [cable identifiers](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/06/identifying-cables/) and now a &#8220;shell&#8221; for 3rd generation iPod Shuffle. As soon as i saw the latest [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle) i knew there&#8217;d be a market for a &#8220;jacket&#8221; that added controls to the body of the button-free MP3 player (I&#8217;d certainly buy one). Alas i failed to turn the designs in my head into reality before [Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/saving_interface_tiny_shuffle_needs_chunky_case_13729.asp) pointed out the [Scosche tapSTICK](http://scosche.com/products/productID/1848)&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" title="tapSTICK" src="/images/fromwp/2009/06/tapSTICK.jpg" alt="tapSTICK" width="500" height="375" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/06/tapSTICK.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2009/06/tapSTICK-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Just slot your 3rd gen Shuffle into the back of it, and voila you have a tiny-though-not-quite-as-tiny Shuffle complete with buttons and the freedom to use whatever headphones you like. Excellent.

Obvioulsy the tapSTICK isn&#8217;t as pretty as the device i&#8217;d invented in my mind&#8217;s eye but at least you can actually buy it&#8230;
