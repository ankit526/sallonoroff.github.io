&#8230;the world, according to Microsoft's Office Labs at least, will look like this:

{% include youtubeembed.html id="8Ff7SzP4gfg" %}

It certainly looks like a spiffy place to live. I do wonder if MS could actually create things so beautiful and seamless in reality though? And how much it'll cost to be a part of? Time will tell i suppose.

For anyone that's still reading, there's a bit more information and a slightly better quality version of the video available on [this Office Labs page](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/futurevisionmontage/Pages/default.aspx).
