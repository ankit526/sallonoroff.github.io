&#8230;the world, according to Microsoft&#8217;s Office Labs at least, will look like this:

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

It certainly looks like a spiffy place to live. I do wonder if MS could actually create things so beautiful and seamless in reality though? And how much it&#8217;ll cost to be a part of? Time will tell i suppose.

For anyone that&#8217;s still reading, there&#8217;s a bit more information and a slightly better quality version of the video available on [this Office Labs page](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/futurevisionmontage/Pages/default.aspx).
