A [house](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/06/14/house-made-of-bookca.html) built to be lined floor-to-ceiling (and beyond) with bookshelves. Utterly brilliant.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1446" title="bookcasehouse1" src="/images/fromwp/2012/01/bookcasehouse1.jpg" alt="Kazuya Morita Architecture Studio bookshelf house" width="450" height="675" srcset="/images/fromwp/2012/01/bookcasehouse1.jpg 450w, /images/fromwp/2012/01/bookcasehouse1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />

Take a look at the architect&#8217;s webpage for more photos of this incredible building. I love it. But a question: is it _enough_ shelf space?
