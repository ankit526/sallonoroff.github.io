Long-time followers will recall that i have been [banging on](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/shiny-new-apple-products/) [about](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/10/all-panel-laptop/) [dual-screen](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2010/01/ds/) laptops for some time. The concept really excites me[^fn-ugh] and so i was rather pleased to discover this morning that Toshiba are actually releasing one. No word on pricing yet, but according to [The Register](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/21/toshiba_libretto_w100/) the Toshiba Libretto W100 &#8220;netbook&#8221; will be available come July&#8230;

[^fn-ugh]: No, not like that.
