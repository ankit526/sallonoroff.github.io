<drum roll>

Numbers drawn: **33, 34, 37, 40, 41, 47** ****+ bonus ball **05**

My Numbers: **05, 11, 13, 21, 25, 37**

No. of matching numbers: **1 + bonus ball**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Weird to see the numbers starting so high. To be expected in a random draw of course but i suppose the human mind spots oddities like this. Anyway, another tuppence interest in the Not A Lottery account.

**Lottery balance: -£49.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £49.12**
