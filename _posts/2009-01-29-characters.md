I recently found [this cache](http://flickr.com/photos/lwr/collections/72157594587080023/) of (photos of) letters. That is to say, those things words are built with&#8230; not those things built with words. A wonderful resource available under [a Creative Commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/). All hail [Leo Rynolds](http://flickr.com/photos/lwr/).

Oh, and whilst i&#8217;m on with images&#8230; [Mandolux](http://www.mandolux.com/) is _always_ worth a look. Mando takes some stunningly beautiful pictures which work very well as desktop wallpaper.
