Last week there was a great deal of interest in [Apple's](http://www.apple.com/) freshly unveiled [MacBook](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/10/20/macbook-updated-with-led-display-multi-touch-7-hour-battery/) and new [27-inch iMac](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/10/20/apple-releases-updated-imac-models-with-21-5-and-27-inch-led-screens/) but, from where i was sitting at least, it seemed most excitement was generated by Apple's [Magic Mouse](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/10/20/apple-introduces-magic-mouse-a-multi-touch-mouse/). This new pointing device adheres to Apple's unwritten law that a mouse should only have a single physical button ...but then actually provides a modern, multi-button device via its multi-touch surface. Trés fancy.

Anyway, like i said, the tech world seemed to get pretty excited about the Magic Mouse[^fn-lazysorry] but now it's finally out in the real world it seems it doesn't quite meet expectations (or should that be &#8220;live up to the hype&#8221;?).

[The Reg reckons](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/10/23/review_accessories_apple_mighty_mouse/) the multi-touch gestures aren't upto much and you need long fingers to enjoy the mouse properly anyway, [Leander Kahney over at Cult of Mac finds](http://www.cultofmac.com/review-i-want-to-love-the-magic-mouse-but-i-cant) the thing frustrating, as the multi-touch isn't similar enough to that used in Apple's notebooks and [Jon Hicks isn't that convinced](http://twitter.com/Hicksdesign/status/5286330534) either.

To be honest, I can't say i'm surprised with these reactions. Upon it's unveiling [i did admire the Magic Mouse's styling](http://twitter.com/sallonoroff) but was a little concerned that the multi-touch functionality wasn't all it should have been. I haven't had a hands-on with the device yet but when i do i expect, like Leander, i'll struggle with having to use one finger for scrolling (i'm used to using two on my MacBook trackpad) and find the combination of trackpad and mouse a little confusing.

Of course I may find it sublime and wish i'd waited before publishing this post.

[^fn-lazysorry]: I can&#8217;t be arsed to produce examples/sources. Just go back to 20th October in the archives of any Mac/Tech news site, blog or Twitter feed and you&#8217;ll undoubtedly see the sort of giddiness i&#8217;m referring to.

**Update:** Since writing this piece I have had a quick play with the Magic Mouse. Sadly the iMac it was hooked up to was pretty bare and had no internet access (what a great way to demo machines, John Lewis!) , so i had very few documents to test out the new mouse with. However, i did what i could and discovered:

  * One finger does scroll but you _can_ use two fingers. I guess it isn't fussy about the number of digits you use. (_phew!_)
  * Sideways scrolling seemed a bit flakey. (Although thinking about it now, maybe that was because i was using 2 fingers?)
  * You have to lift your fingers off the mouse surface in order for a &#8220;right click&#8221; to register. This was a complaint often aimed at the Mighty Mouse, which the Magic Mouse replaces. Clearly Apple doesn't see this as a problem.
  * MacBook trackpads can be setup to &#8220;click&#8221; without physically depressing the trackpad button. I was disappointed to find that you can't setup the mouse like this. A tap-to-click option makes sense to me but obviously not to Apple's engineers.

All-in-all, I was a little disappointed with the Magic Mouse. Don't get me wrong, if you get one with the new iMac you won't be throwing it away in disgust &#8211; there's nothing _wrong_ with it. It's just that there's nothing really _special_ about it. Maybe if more gestures can be added with future software/firmware updates then i might change my mind.
