Dear Reader, a couple of jokes for you.

The first one goes like this&#8230;

> _A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, &#8220;Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?&#8221;_
> 
> _The man below says: &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.&#8221;_
> 
> _&#8220;You must work in Information Technology,&#8221; says the balloonist._
> 
> _&#8220;I do&#8221; replies the man. &#8220;How did you know?&#8221;_
> 
> _&#8220;Well,&#8221; says the balloonist, &#8220;everything you have told me is technically correct, but It&#8217;s of no use to anyone.&#8221;_
> 
> _The man below replies, &#8220;You must work in management.&#8221;</p> 
> 
> &#8220;I do&#8221; replies the balloonist, &#8220;But how&#8217;d you know?&#8221;
> 
> </em>_&#8220;Well&#8221;, says the man, &#8220;you don’t know where you are, or where you’re going, you expect me to be able to help. You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault.&#8221;_</blockquote>

> > _A physicist, an engineer and a programmer were in a car driving over a steep alpine pass when the brakes failed. The car was getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt._

> > _The physicist said &#8220;We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed&#8221;._
> > 
> > _The engineer said &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve got a few tools in the back. I&#8217;ll take a look and see if I can work out what&#8217;s wrong&#8221;._
> > 
> > _The programmer said &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we get going again and see if it&#8217;s reproducible?&#8221;_
