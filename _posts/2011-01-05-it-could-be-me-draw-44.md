And did the fact that ICBM draw number 44 fell on New Year&#8217;s Day bring me any luck?

Numbers drawn: **04, 09, 33, 34, 36, 45** + bonus ball **26**

My Numbers: **02, 16, 17, 31, 32, 36**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Of course not. I hate 2011 already. Still there has probably been another couple of pence in interest added to the Not A Lottery account (if i bothered to check it).

**Lottery balance: £-44.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £44.08**
