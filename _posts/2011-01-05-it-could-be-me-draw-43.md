So, did the fact that ICBM draw number 43 fell on Christmas Day bring me any luck?

Numbers drawn: **13, 15, 22, 25, 33, 34** + bonus ball **17**

My Numbers: **02, 10, 13, 15, 35, 49**

No. of matching numbers: **2**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Nope. I must have been on Santa&#8217;s naughty list.

**Lottery balance: £-43.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £43.08**
