It&#8217;s that time of year again &#8211; April Fools Day. You fall for the first fake news story you see that morning and then treat every other you read that day skeptically, seeing everything as ridiculous, even those that clearly aren&#8217;t.

TheRegister has their usual collection of tom-foolery [HERE](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/watch_out_london/), [HERE](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/apple_secrecy_patent/) and [HERE](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/skype_nsa_backdoor_iphone_deal/)&#8230; and [another](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/laptops_direct_offer/) which i&#8217;m still actually undecided about. Oh, but [the one about the Motorola phone](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/04/01/review_phone_motorola_aura/) that costs over Â£1200 is real apparently.

Over at Google, [this year&#8217;s efforts](http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/landing/cadie/) sadly aren&#8217;t as good as last year&#8217;s [Virgle](http://www.google.com/virgle/) ruse or 2007&#8217;s [Gmail Paper](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html) announcement.

Meanwhile, the [Guardian claims](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/01/guardian-twitter-media-technology) it is switching to publishing exclusively via Twitter and Kodak&#8217;s homepage announced the introduction of the &#8220;[eyeCamera](http://aprilfoolsdayontheweb.com/joke/6309/?size=1)&#8220;.

Oh, and BMW had this ad printed in at least one UK newspaper&#8230;

  I must admit it had me going for a while. Gullible bastard.
