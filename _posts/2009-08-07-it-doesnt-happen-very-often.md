Today this will happen&#8230;Â **12:34:56 7/8/9**. Lovely stuff.

That is unless you prefer to use leading zeroes in the date. Or you always write out the date in full. Or indeed if you're a silly American. In any of these cases nothing particularly interesting is happening with regard timestamps today, so forget i said anything.
