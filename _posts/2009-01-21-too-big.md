I appreciate that some people have poor eyesight, and might refuse to wear specs, but isn&#8217;t this going a bit far&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-198" title="bigremote" src="/images/fromwp/2009/02/bigremote.jpg" alt="bigremote" width="300" height="257" />

Oh how i laughed when i spotted this in Maplin&#8217;s Sale leaflet. It&#8217;s just incredible. Why on Earth would you want a remote control _THAT_ big?! Look at it! It&#8217;s mammoth. According to the <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=225778" target="_blank">specs</a> it&#8217;s nearly as long as a piece of A4 paper and over half the width. If you need a remote control that size, how big is your telly? And how close to it do you have to sit?

(BTW, apologies for the piss-poor photo. A combination of my phone&#8217;s shit camera and my unsteady hand I&#8217;m afraid. I had hoped there&#8217;d be the same image on the Maplin website but alas no.)
