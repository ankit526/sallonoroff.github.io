I appreciate that some people have poor eyesight, and might refuse to wear specs, but isn't this going a bit far...[^fn-apols]

Oh how i laughed when i spotted this in Maplin's Sale leaflet. It's just incredible. Why on Earth would you want a remote control _THAT_ big?! Look at it! It's mammoth. According to the [specs](http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=225778) it's nearly as long as a piece of A4 paper and over half the width. If you need a remote control that size, how big is your telly? And how close to it do you have to sit?

[^fn-apols]: Apologies for the piss-poor photo. A combination of my phone's shit camera and my unsteady hand I'm afraid. I had hoped there'd be the same image on the Maplin website but alas no.
