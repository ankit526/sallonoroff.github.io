So, _Which?_ is [warning consumers](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hrEw3xZmtzdBSaqsA8EKhJumvmZA) that they might not be getting the best price by buying services through price comparison websites.

Shock-horror! Things cost more when you involve middlemen?! Who'd have thunk it, eh?

Don&#8217;t want to ring around every provider? Here&#8217;s an idea: Just use the price comparison site of your choice to narrow down your options to, say, the cheapest three&#8230; then just call those directly and get a quote. It&#8217;ll almost certainly be cheaper than the online price you&#8217;re seeing. Afterwards, mention finding them through a price comparison site and you might get further &#8220;online&#8221; discount too. I know it&#8217;s worked for me.

I never cease to be amazed by the number of people who just _assume_ that because something is available to buy online that it must be cheaper than if you were to buy it in the &#8220;real world&#8221;. More than a few times i&#8217;ve seen items sell for way above even their high street rrp on Ebay just because someone _assumes_ that items listed on there must be a bargain.
