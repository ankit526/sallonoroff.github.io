I thought i&#8217;d blogged before about the novel and rather fetching [QLOCKTWO](http://qlocktwo.com/info.php?lang=en) clock, but apparently not. Odd, given how much I crave one. Anyway, i&#8217;ve [just discovered](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/the_qlocktwo_touch_not_for_the_illiterate_20540.asp) that the makers, Biegert & Funk, have created an bed-side alarm clock version: [the QLOCKTWO TOUCH](http://qlocktwo.com/touch.php?lang=en).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1457" title="QLOCKTWO TOUCH" src="/images/fromwp/2012/01/Q2Touch_BlackIceTea.jpg" alt="QLOCKTWO TOUCH" width="450" height="450" srcset="/images/fromwp/2012/01/Q2Touch_BlackIceTea.jpg 450w, /images/fromwp/2012/01/Q2Touch_BlackIceTea-150x150.jpg 150w, /images/fromwp/2012/01/Q2Touch_BlackIceTea-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />

I think it&#8217;s gorgeous. But at about £320 it&#8217;s maybe just a little bit too pricey for me right now. (I could probably stretch to the [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/time-in-words-qlocktwo/id317894604) version though)
