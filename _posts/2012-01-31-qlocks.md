I thought i'd blogged before about the novel and rather fetching [QLOCKTWO](http://qlocktwo.com/info.php?lang=en) clock, but apparently not. Odd, given how much I crave one. Anyway, i've [just discovered](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/the_qlocktwo_touch_not_for_the_illiterate_20540.asp) that the makers, Biegert & Funk, have created an bed-side alarm clock version: [the QLOCKTWO TOUCH](http://qlocktwo.com/touch.php?lang=en).

I think it's gorgeous. But at about £320 it's maybe just a little bit too pricey for me right now. (I could probably stretch to the [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/time-in-words-qlocktwo/id317894604) version though.)
