[Here&#8217;s a great blog post](http://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165) about passwords &#8211; particularly password strength meters &#8211; by Dan Wheeler on the Dropbox tech blog. He&#8217;s coded a password tester that he hopes is more useful than existing (and generally rather simplistic) offerings.

I won&#8217;t try to pretend that I followed the rather technical and mathematical bits in the middle of the piece but the bits I did understand I found really interesting.

You can try Dan&#8217;s password strength tester [HERE](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html). And afterwards you&#8217;ll probably find yourself considering changing one or two passwords.

**PS:** After reading through the comments on Dan&#8217;s post, here are a few more password-related tools that you may or may not find useful&#8230;

[GRC&#8217;s Interactive Brute Force Search Space Calculator](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm) (I&#8217;ve long been a user of their [Password Generator](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm) but this calculator is news to me)

[Wordkey App](http://chxo.com/widgets/wordkey/wordkey.html)
