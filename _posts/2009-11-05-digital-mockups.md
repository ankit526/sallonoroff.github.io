AppleÂ fanaticism breeds a lots of rumours but those which have an associated digital mockup always cause much more of a stir amongst the Mac-nuts.

I think i&#8217;ve mentioned [MacPredictions.com](http://www.macpredictions.com/) on here before now &#8211; they produce some great mockups on occasion &#8211; but i&#8217;ve just discovered another site that maybe does an even better job of it. Check out [New Species Apple Laboratory](http://applestylelabo.wordpress.com/).

Blogger Isamu Sanada has produced some great designs but i think my favourite has to be his re-imagined [Mac Mini](http://applestylelabo.wordpress.com/2008/11/20/mac-mini-081120/)&#8230;
