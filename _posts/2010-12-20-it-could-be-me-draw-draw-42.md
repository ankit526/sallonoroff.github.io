Draw number 42. Forty-two being [the answer to Life, The Universe and Everything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#In_The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), of course…

Numbers drawn: **09, 21, 35, 38, 46, 49** + bonus ball **40**

My Numbers: **05, 11, 33, 39, 43, 47**

No. of matching numbers: ****

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

&#8230;But apparently not my financial worries. Not a single number. Oh well, maybe the Christmas draw next week will spread some joy and happiness my way.

**Lottery balance: £-42.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £42.08**
