Look mum, no menu bar.

The Angry Birds dislodged something.

Usage anomaly.

First _Cards_ was blank...

![Missing icon 2](/images/fromwp/2012/02/Photo-08-12-2011-07-28-49.png){:class="img-responsive"}
...But then it came back and _Voice Memos_ vanished...

![Missing icon 3](/images/fromwp/2012/02/Photo-08-12-2011-07-29-02.png){:class="img-responsive"}
...before reappearing and _Stocks_ going blank.
