Apple&#8217;s iPhoto software very cleverly checks whether you really want to import that photo that you already have in your library but nevertheless I always manage to happen across duplicated photos from time to time. And when I do, I always think &#8220;Oh, i&#8217;ll just check if there are any more&#8221; then promptly waste 3-4 minutes checking and re-checking the various menus and buttons for the &#8220;Find Duplicates&#8221; function. It doesn&#8217;t exist. There&#8217;s one in iTunes but not in iPhoto.

If you&#8217;re similarly afflicted, I can confirm that the tiny little AppleScript available at [blog.spoolz.com/2008/11/03/iphoto-applescript-to-remove-duplicates/](http://blog.spoolz.com/2008/11/03/iphoto-applescript-to-remove-duplicates/ "blog.spoolz.com/2008/11/03/iphoto-applescript-to-remove-duplicates/") is excellent and, despite being published in 2008, still works with iPhoto 9.6 under OS X Yosemite. Just remember to select a bunch of photos in iPhoto before running the script. I definitely didn&#8217;t forget to do that and sit wondering why it hadn&#8217;t worked. Anyway, thank you Karl!

Now, whether the script will work, could be re-written to work or, indeed, is even required in the [upcoming Photos app for OS X](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/02/os-x-yosemite-public-beta-now-available/) remains to be seen.
