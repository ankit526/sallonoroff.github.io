Hello there. Thanks for stopping by at my little cul-de-sac on the InterWeb.

[Apparently](http://twitter.com/dave_turner/status/3755173532), visitors will come gather around the flame of my blog like the proverbial moths if i utter the simple magic words &#8220;**Princess Leia Gold Bikini**&#8220;.

I&#8217;m just seeing if this is true or not. Sorry for any confusion or inconvenience caused.

By way of an apology though, here is the famous bikini&#8230;

<div id="attachment_683" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-683" title="slaveleia" src="/images/fromwp/2009/09/slaveleia.jpg" alt="Princess Leia and her famous Gold Bikini." width="432" height="324" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/09/slaveleia.jpg 432w, /images/fromwp/2009/09/slaveleia-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Princess Leia and her Gold Bikini.
  </p>
</div>

Lovely.

Now please go and look at some of my other posts. They&#8217;re not about Princess Leia, Boba Fett or even Salacious Crumb but they are about geeky things. Geeky things like [lovely Apples](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/tag/apple/), [laptop designs](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/tag/design/), [Twitter](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/tag/twitter/) and [general sputum from around the Internet](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/tag/arbitrary/).

**Update:** That &#8220;apparently&#8221; link above is out of date, since Dave changed his twitter username. [This one](http://twitter.com/armyofdave/status/3755173532) should work though.
