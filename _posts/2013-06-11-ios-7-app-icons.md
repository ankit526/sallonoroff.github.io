Last night Apple [unveiled a whole heap of stuff](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4413228/apple-wwdc-2013-everything-you-need-to-know) at the WWDC 2013 Keynote event. It&#8217;s all rather exciting and you&#8217;ll find lots of words already added to the Internet about [iOS 7](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/10Apple-Unveils-iOS-7.html), [OS X Mavericks](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/10Apple-Releases-Developer-Preview-of-OS-X-Mavericks-With-More-Than-200-New-Features.html), the [new Mac Pro](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/10Apple-Gives-Sneak-Peek-Into-the-Future-of-the-Pro-Desktop.html) and so on. I won&#8217;t bother adding my own recap here. What i do want to mention though are the app icons Apple has produced for iOS 7. I think this new iOS is beautiful &#8211; take a look at the [screenshots and videos](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/) and you&#8217;ll see light and elegant new interfaces to all the familiar apps &#8211; and yet the homescreen includes some garish, inconsistent and, dare i say it, ugly icons.

<div id="attachment_1746" style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-1746" alt="iOS 7 homescreen" src="/images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7screen.png" width="415" height="740" srcset="/images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7screen.png 415w, /images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7screen-168x300.png 168w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" />

For me, these new icons fall into four categories:

**Like!** &#8211; Calendar, Photos.

**Yeah, ok, fine** &#8211; Messages, Clock, Maps, Videos, Passbook, Compass, Phone, Music.

**Not so keen on that** &#8211; Camera, Weather, Notes, Reminders, Stocks, Game Center, Settings

**Fucking hell, Apple** &#8211; Newsstand, iTunes Store, App Store, Mail, Safari

Of course, aesthetics are subjective. You surely don&#8217;t agree with my categorisations. And i expect that some of these designs will grow on me and i&#8217;ll look back at this post with embarrassment. But right now i really hope some of these icons see lots of &#8220;refinement&#8221; before iOS 7&#8217;s release later in the year.

**Update:** I&#8217;ve realised that the above screenshot is missing a few of the new icons. Here are Calculator, Contacts and FaceTime&#8230;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" alt="iOS 7 Calculator, Contacts, Facetime icons" src="/images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7others.jpg" width="306" height="100" srcset="/images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7others.jpg 306w, /images/fromwp/2013/06/ios7others-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now, Calculator and FaceTime just fall in the &#8220;Yeah, ok, fine&#8221; category but i&#8217;m afraid that Contacts icon needs a new category all of its own. Just horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. No wonder it is missing from most of Apple&#8217;s current marketing materials.

  I&#8217;ve also realised that the Voice Memos app is missing from iOS 7 at the moment. Presumably it hasn&#8217;t been cut altogether, rather i imagine it has the misfortune of simultaneously being low down the priorities and a difficult interface to &#8220;flatten&#8221;. It will be interesting to see how Apple replaces that gorgeous old microphone.

  <strong>Update #2</strong>: Designer Frank Chimero has written an excellent and altogether more informed piece on iOS 7&#8217;s interface at <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/06/generosity-of-perspective/">http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/06/generosity-of-perspective/</a>. Well worth a read.
