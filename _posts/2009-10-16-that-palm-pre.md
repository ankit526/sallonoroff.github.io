Last week [i said](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/10/decisions-decisions/) i was no longer interested in the Palm Pre. [The Register's review](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/10/16/review_phone_palm_pre) of the new GSM-compatible Pre doesn't help change my mind&#8230;

> _This was the phone that was supposed to turn around Palm’s fortunes and provide the iPhone with something to truly worry about and, in its current form, with its current price, it does neither._
> 
> _Unless (or until) the price drops, those who have been waiting to see if Palm’s best can match the iPhone should be following in the footsteps of the Apple fans._

Admittedly this final verdict is more negative than the rest of the article (where the hardware design and webOS in particular are praised) but it does sound very much like most other reviews of the device: Good, but no iPhone 3GS.

**PS.** If you are still interested though, the Pre is [available from today](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/10/16/pre_launch_day/) through [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/palmpre)&#8230;
