Rumour has it that we&#8217;ll see two new iPhone models announced at [next week&#8217;s Apple event](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/03/apple-issues-invitations-for-september-10-media-event/) &#8211; the iPhone 5S, a successor to the iPhone 5, and the iPhone 5C, a new &#8220;lower cost&#8221; iPhone.

Historically the current iPhone model would become the cheaper, second-tier offering once a newer version is available but the rumoured 5C could change that MO. Will the two new models come in and replace the current 5 / 4S / 4 line-up entirely? Perhaps the 5S and 5C will sit either side of the iPhone 5, thus scrapping the 4/4S? Or maybe the 4S will actually sit as the lowest cost option beneath 5S and 5C? Of course nobody outside Apple will know for sure until next week but I suspect it&#8217;s going to be the former and the new models will form the entire range between them.

Here&#8217;s what i&#8217;m expecting from the new devices, an amalgam of my hopes and my fears. I&#8217;ve tried to keep it sensible but may have succumbed to the odd wild rumour*&#8230;

That&#8217;s all guesswork, naturally. Don&#8217;t phone, it&#8217;s just for fun. The only certainties here are that Apple will announce something next week, the media will pick on the one immediately obvious but minor flaw** and customers will buy the product regardless.

*Â Yes, i&#8217;ve gone with that crazy fingerprint recognition rumour. My suggestion is a scanner beneath the lower portion of the screen, rather than in the Home button. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s technically feasible yet but much as I like the idea of a scanner being in the Home button &#8211; it seems the immediately obvious place to put it &#8211; the fingerprint recognition tech i&#8217;ve seen on computers before requires a swipe of a digit. And there&#8217;s a part of the iPhone where we swipe a digit already. No?

** Unless there&#8217;s something radical, my money is on it being that the &#8220;cheap&#8221; 5C isn&#8217;t cheap enough.
