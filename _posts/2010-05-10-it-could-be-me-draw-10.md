The 10th ICBM draw (or Lotto draw #1500, if you prefer) took place on Saturday night and do you know what happened? Go on, have a guess&#8230; YES! That&#8217;s right&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **01, 26, 28, 32, 46, 48** + bonus ball **10**

My Numbers: ******6**, ******9**, **16**, **23**, **27**, **32**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

After failing to win a single bean yet again i decided to make use of the wonderful stats over at [lottery.merseyworld.com](http://lottery.merseyworld.com/) in order to find out how many times &#8220;My Numbers&#8221; have won a prize in the history of the National Lottery. The answer? 14. Yes, that&#8217;s fourteen. That particular set of six numbers has won a prize in just 14 Saturday draws since 1994. No wonder the two balances continue to look like this:

**Lottery balance: £-10  //  Not A Lottery balance: £10**
