Another week, another set of balls selected at random from a specially manufactured machine&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **﻿﻿12, 22, 30, 31, 34, 39** + bonus ball **36**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: ****

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

I&#8217;ve fancied changing my numbers for weeks now but haven&#8217;t yet gotten around to it. I expect there will be another penny of interest in the Not a Lottery bank account too but i haven&#8217;t checked it yet. (Do you see a pattern forming here?)

**Lottery balance: £-36.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £36.05**
