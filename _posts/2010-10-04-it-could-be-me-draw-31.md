Another week, another lottery draw…

Numbers drawn: **10, 16, 25, 26, 32, 40** ****+ bonus ball **46**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: ****

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

According to the Lotto people, over 520,000 tickets matched 3 balls and won £10 this week. Not me though. Not me. I probably earned another penny in interest on the Not A Lottery account though (i&#8217;m yet to check). Joy.

**Lottery balance: £-31  //  Not A Lottery balance: £31.04**
