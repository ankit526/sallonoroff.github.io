This week was the first use of a Lucky Dip ticket in this experiment. Let&#8217;s see if a randomly selected set of numbers faired any better than the usual ones&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **11, 15, 24, 33, 43, 49** ****+ bonus ball **27**

My Numbers: **02, 03, 16, 19, 27, 30**

No. of matching numbers: **bonus ball**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

One number matched. If i&#8217;d stuck with my usual numbers i&#8217;d have matched two. No prize either way so i can hardly claim to be upset or disappointed. If you&#8217;d like to play along at home and share my jubilation/disappointment next week i can tell you that my Lucky Dip numbers are 05, 11, 33, 39, 43 and 47. Meanwhile, i can report that the Not A Lottery bank account accrued _two_ pence interest last month. TWO PENCE! This shit is getting wild.

**Lottery balance: £-41.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £41.08**
