There's a cartoon in the free Metro newspaper called This Life. It's drawn by Rick Brookes and is a fine example of topical British satire. Here's yesterday's, for example:

![This Life, Metro 2009-03-02](/images/fromwp/2009/03/brookes-metro-20090302.jpg)

Sadly there's no online archive of this work, so i had take a screengrab from the [e-Metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/e-metro). Thus giving this post a very tenuous tech-angle.
