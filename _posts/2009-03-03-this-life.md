There&#8217;s a cartoon in the free Metro newspaper called This Life. It&#8217;s drawn by Rick Brookes and is a fine example of topical British satire. Here&#8217;s yesterday&#8217;s:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-285" title="brookes-metro-20090302" src="/images/fromwp/2009/03/brookes-metro-20090302.jpg" alt="brookes-metro-20090302" width="662" height="223" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/03/brookes-metro-20090302.jpg 736w, /images/fromwp/2009/03/brookes-metro-20090302-300x101.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" />
</p>

(Sadly there&#8217;s no online archive of this work, so i had take a screengrab from the [e-Metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/e-metro). Thus giving this post a vaguely tech-angle.)
