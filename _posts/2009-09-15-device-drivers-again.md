A while ago [I highlighted a few free tools](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/device-drivers/) for saving the device drivers on your Windows PC. These are very handy when you need to format the machine and have lost the manufacturer-supplied discs ...but what happens if you've already formatted the PC before you discover you've lost the CD? Well, assuming something likeÂ [PC Wizard](http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php) can't help you, then you'll be stuck playing detective. If you do find yourself in this predicament then you may find [these instructions from command-tab](http://www.command-tab.com/2009/09/13/how-to-find-the-right-windows-driver/) very useful indeed.
