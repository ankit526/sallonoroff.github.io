A while ago [I highlighted](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/device-drivers/) a few free tools for saving the device drivers on your Windows PC. These are very handy when you need to format the machine but &#8216;ve lost the manufacturer-supplied discs, but what happens if you&#8217;ve already formatted the PC before you discover you&#8217;ve lost the CD? Well, assuming something likeÂ [PC Wizard](http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php) can&#8217;t help you, then you&#8217;ll be stuck playing detective. If you find yourself in this predicament then you may find [these instructions from command-tab](http://www.command-tab.com/2009/09/13/how-to-find-the-right-windows-driver/) very useful indeed.
