Forget &#8220;iTunes DJ&#8221; &#8211; the best new feature of recently released iTunes 8.1 is [Autofill](http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/features/#itunesonthego)! This previously iPod-Shuffle-only feature fills your &#8216;Pod with a random selection of music from your library. If, like me, you don&#8217;t really bother with Playlists in iTunes and don&#8217;t have an iPod with the capacity to sync your entire library (and don&#8217;t fancy listening to something in particular) Autofill is a god-send. Just strange it&#8217;s taken this long to appear.
