Have you heard about the [OpenOfficeMouse](http://openofficemouse.com/)? If not, here&#8217;s a picture&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764" title="theopenofficemouse" src="/images/fromwp/2009/11/theopenofficemouse.jpg" alt="theopenofficemouse" width="500" height="320" srcset="/images/fromwp/2009/11/theopenofficemouse.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2009/11/theopenofficemouse-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

They say a picture is worth a thousand words and I think that in this particular case each of those is &#8220;what?!&#8221;.

I can&#8217;t see how anyone can even begin to think that this thing is real &#8211; look at it! &#8211; though [apparently](http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/06/openofficemouse-isnt-free-isnt-pretty/) it is. I maintain that this is a hoax but if it is no-one&#8217;s let on yet.

**Update:** [OpenOffice](http://openoffice.org/) [have denied](http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/09/openoffice-distances-itself-from-openofficemouse-joins-everyone/) any involvement, _thankfully_. The OpenOfficeMouse has since changed it&#8217;s name to OOMouse.
