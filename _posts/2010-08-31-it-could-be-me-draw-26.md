This saturday's lottery draw marked the half-way point of my It Could Be Me experiment. Did anything notable happen? (No)

Numbers drawn: **03, 17, 32, 35, 43, 49** + bonus ball **27**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **0**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

So, we're half-way. Last week i mentioned some in-depth analysis. Unfortunately i haven't got around to performing any so you'll have to make do with this for now: 6 months and i've won bugger-all.

**Lottery balance: £-26  //  Not A Lottery balance: £26.03**
