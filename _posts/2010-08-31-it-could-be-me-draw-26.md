So, this saturday&#8217;s lottery draw marked the half-way point of my It Could Be Me experiment. Did anything notable happen? (No)

Numbers drawn: **03, 17, 32, 35, 43, 49** + bonus ball **27**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: ****

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

So, we&#8217;re half-way. Last week i mentioned some in-depth analysis. Unfortunately i haven&#8217;t got around to performing any so you&#8217;ll have to make do with this for now: 6 months and i&#8217;ve won bugger-all.

**Lottery balance: £-26  //  Not A Lottery balance: £26.03**
