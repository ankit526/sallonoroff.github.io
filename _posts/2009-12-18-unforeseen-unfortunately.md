Fitting traffic lights with LEDs is a good idea, right? They&#8217;re as bright as traditional lamps but with just a fraction of the energy costs. What could possibly go wrong? Well, how about that [LEDs give off so little heat that they can&#8217;t melt any snow that gathers on them](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091215/ap_on_re_us/us_snow_covered_stoplights).

I wonder if anyone foresaw this? I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have.
