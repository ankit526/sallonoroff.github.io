Well, the Apple tablet is finally here. Announced yesterday, the new [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad) is, according to Apple&#8217;s own trumpet, their &#8220;most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price&#8221;.

The [guesses i made yesterday](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2010/01/nearly/) were mostly off* but, in hindsight, only because i&#8217;d convinced myself there&#8217;d be 3g operator subsidies affecting the pricing (which there aren&#8217;t). Had i gone with my gut instinct, i&#8217;d have stuck my neck out and said there&#8217;d be a wifi only model at a surprisingly low price. Turns out the iPod touch was a good clue to iPad pricing.

Anyway, the actual device looks great &#8211; and is priced very reasonably for an Apple product (i&#8217;m assuming $499 works out at something like £349 &#8211; no official word yet though). Honestly though, I&#8217;m not tempted. Much like when i saw the iPod and iPhone launches &#8211; i think it&#8217;s cool tech, but not for me. _Yet_.

A few of my immediate reservations about the iPad&#8230;

**Apps.** The iPad will apparently run &#8220;almost all&#8221; apps currently in the App Store. But those iPhone/iPod-sized apps look awkwardly small on such a large screen &#8211; or awkwardly stretched if you make them fullscreen. Sure developers will be fervently scrambling to make iPad compatible versions of their programs but i struggle to see how apps can be designed to work well on both screens. Something like [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/) looks great on both iPhone and Mac OSX, but you certainly don&#8217;t use it in fullscreen on the Mac &#8211; why would you want to on the iPad? Also, take Facebook &#8211; it works well as an app for the iPhone because it&#8217;s more convenient than trying to view the full FB site on an iPhone screen. yet on the iPad the FB site will look fine. No need for an app. I suspect we&#8217;ll end up seeing Apps labelled iPhone-only and iPad-only.

**Keyboard.** The on-screen keyboard entry requires it to be resting on your knee, a table or whatever surface. This seems a very un-Apple-like solution to me. I had hoped Apple would have something smarter &#8211; although the device almost certainly wouldn&#8217;t have retailed for $499 if it had.

**iBooks**. The iPad&#8217;s eBook-reader iBooks is US-only at the moment. Why?! I hope this is just a case of deals not been finalised in Europe in time for the launch announcement. Also, will we see a Mac version of the iBooks? Steve said &#8220;everything&#8221; sync&#8217;d with your Mac&#8230; but Books weren&#8217;t in the list on screen.

But all this is not to say the device will be a flop. There are already many, many very vocal naysayers&#8230; but i just don&#8217;t think they get it. The iPad is a casual device. A device to use when you&#8217;re vegetating on the sofa. This is a device aimed at those people whose imaginations were grabbed by O2&#8217;s Joggler and the like. Sure Apple&#8217;s device isn&#8217;t photo-frame-small and costs a lot more than £150 &#8230;but it&#8217;s that same market.

Let me stop here and suggest you read [this post by Chuq Von Rospach](http://www.chuqui.com/2010/01/some-thoughts-on-the-ipad/) who lays it all out much more clearly.

* Including my assumption that Apple wouldn&#8217;t ever reveal internal specs beyond storage capacity. In addition to the storage capacities, they were quite boastful (and continue to be) about the &#8220;A4&#8221; processor in the iPad, which is of their own design (presumably created by the [PA Semi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A._Semi) intake). This was very surprising and an interesting revelation. Will we see more Apple-designed chips appearing soon? Perhaps in the iPhone?

**Update:** Oh, and regarding my hopes that the tablet announcement might give us some indicator of what hardware and software changes we&#8217;ll see on the next iPhone&#8230; Gunned down. There&#8217;s that chance that the A4 chip (or some other Apple silicon) will make it into the next iPhone, but it&#8217;s far simpler to say that Apple gave away nothing yesterday.
