Another week, another anti-climax&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **05, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29** + bonus ball **31**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

So, no improvement in my &#8220;luck&#8221; but i have had my first &#8220;profit&#8221; in the Not A Lottery account thanks to some interest being accrued. A whole penny of interest. Look:

**Lottery balance: £-14  //  Not A Lottery balance: £14.01**
