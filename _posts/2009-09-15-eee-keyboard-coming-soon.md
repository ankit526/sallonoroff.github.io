And now, rounding off this unintentional trio of re-visiting 6-month-old posts, here's an update on the lovely [Eee Keyboard](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/eee-keyboard/)&#8230; [The Register reports](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/09/14/asus_eee_keyboard_launch/) it'll be available in the UK next month (That's October, for the calendarly-challenged). No word on price yet.

Oh, and it appears to have developed black keys since i last mentioned it&#8230;
