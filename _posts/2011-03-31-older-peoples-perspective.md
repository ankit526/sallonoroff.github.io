Technologizer.com has posted [an iPad review that&#8217;s a little different](http://technologizer.com/2011/03/28/my-mom-reviews-the-ipad-her-first-computer/) &#8211; it&#8217;s actually an interview with a writer&#8217;s 60+ year old mother. She&#8217;s never used a computer of any sort before so it does make for an interesting read.

I&#8217;ve often wondered what my grandparents would make of an iPad. They have a Windows PC at home but have only just got online with it so are still quite new to browsing the web and sending/receiving emails. It&#8217;d be very interesting to see how easy (or not) they found an iPad to use in comparison. You would assume that the touchscreen interface makes the computer more accessible for older folk but it&#8217;d be nice to actually see some evidence of that.

(If anyone has an iPad they want to donate, i&#8217;d gladly pass it on and document my grandparents&#8217; thoughts&#8230;)
