Lately i&#8217;ve been finding it harder and harder to kill time on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/). I don&#8217;t know whether less is _happening_ on there these days or if it&#8217;s just that the recent &#8220;Home&#8221; re-design that just makes it appear that way. Anyway, regardless of the cause, i&#8217;ve been looking for somewhere new on the web to procrastinate (besides here) and yesterday gave-in to the pull of [twitter](http://twitter.com/).

I don&#8217;t know what finally convinced me to give it a try exactly. I think part of it was that &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; might complement this thing nicely (enabling me to quickly record fanciful ideas and otherwise-fleeting thoughts whenever and wherever they struck me) and also, if i&#8217;m perfectly honest, partly to see what all the fuss was about.

It&#8217;s too early to say whether twitter will be of any use to me but i can already tell you what the fuss is all about &#8211; celebrities. Twitter provides the general public an insight into the thoughts and feelings of celebrities in a way that has never been possible before &#8211; but perhaps most importantly also a chance to interact with these people too. I might be wrong of course, there might be something more to it all, but that&#8217;s my immediate feeling.

You can find my (t)witterings at [twitter.com/sallonoroff](http://twitter.com/sallonoroff). (Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t be arsed with reading it &#8211; i aim to have my twitter feed plugged into this blog at some point, so i can bore you in stereo)
