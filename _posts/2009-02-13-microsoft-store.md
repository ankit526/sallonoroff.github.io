Doesn&#8217;t have quite the same ring to it as Apple Store, does it? Following Apple [didn&#8217;t work](http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2008/01/31/dell_abandonds_us_kiosks/) for Dell&#8230; But Microsoft are [reportedly](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/13/microsoft_retail_store/) planning on opening their own retail outlets anyway.

I am curious to know what they&#8217;re planning on selling though. Will it just be a real-world incarnation of their online store, selling boxed copies of Windows and Office, XBOXs, XBOX games and a selection of keyboards, mice and webcams? Or will they be flogging PCs too? But if so, whose PCs? Dell? Sony? HP? Toshiba? All PC manufacturers? Political minefield, methinks.

Definitely an interesting prospect though, MS having a physical presence where customers can talk face-to-face with them. Personally,Â  I can&#8217;t wait for the first Youtube vid of some irate Windows user giving an unsuspecting Microsoft &#8220;genius&#8221; a right ear-bending&#8230;
