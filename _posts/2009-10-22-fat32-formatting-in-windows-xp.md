Ever noticed that the Disk Management tool in Windows XP won&#8217;t let you format your external hard drives or USB flash drives with the FAT32 filesystem? Annoying isn&#8217;t it? In the past when i&#8217;ve wanted to avoid having to do an NTFS format i&#8217;ve resorted to a Linux LiveCDÂ to do FAT32. That&#8217;s a bit of a faff though, so i was quite relieved when i happened across &#8220;[SwissKnife](http://www.compuapps.com/download/Swissknife/swissknife.htm)&#8221; and &#8220;[FAT32format](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/fat32format.htm)&#8221; today. Both are free tools for formatting >32gb disks with the FAT32 filesystem under Windows.

I&#8217;ve only tried (the [GUI version](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/guiformat.htm) of) FAT32format so far but it worked perfectly and the &#8220;quick format&#8221; option was, well, _very_ quick on the 80gb drive i tested with. Can&#8217;t ask for more really.
