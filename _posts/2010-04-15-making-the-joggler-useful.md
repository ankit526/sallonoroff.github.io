Since many people seem to end up here after searching for things like &#8220;hacking the o2 joggler&#8221; i thought i&#8217;d take a moment to highlight [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn-teXLhRQQ) of a Joggler running Google Chrome on Ubuntu linux. It finally looks like someone has made the Joggler useful&#8230;

Some instructions on how to get Ubuntu onto the Joggler are [here](http://magician.gforums.de/wiki/index.php5?title=UNE_Installation). (Incidentally, that whole [site](http://magician.gforums.de/) is full of interesting-looking Joggler jiggery-pokery.)

Also, you may be interested to know that O2 are now flogging the Joggler for just [£49.99](http://shop.o2.co.uk/joggler) (down from the already reduced price of £100).
