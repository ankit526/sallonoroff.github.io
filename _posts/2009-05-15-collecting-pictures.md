There are plenty of blogs out there that collate theme-specific images and in the past i&#8217;ve linked to some good examples (about [fo](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/where-dreams-become-heart-attacks/)[od](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/for-education-and-delight/) and [poor english](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/04/literally-unnecessary-apostrophes/)) but lately there seems to have been a bit of an explosion of these sites (Or perhaps it&#8217;s just twitter that&#8217;s exposing me to them more?). [FAILblog](http://failblog.org/), [Engrish Funny](http://engrishfunny.com/), [Cake Wrecks](http://cakewrecks.blogspot.com/), [Awkward Boners](http://www.awkwardboners.com/) and [Awkward Family Photos](http://awkwardfamilyphotos.com/) are all excellent examples but my new favourites of this genre just have to beÂ [Photoshop Disasters](http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/) and [Passive Aggressive Notes](http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/).

Here are some great Photoshop Disasters&#8230;

[Vanity Fair: Sleeve It Out](http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2009/02/vanity-fair-sleeve-it-out.html)

[Boart Longyear: Corporate Report And Death To America](http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2009/05/boart-longyear-corporate-report-and.html)

[AT&T: Whoops](http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2009/02/at-whoops.html)

[Mystery Meat: Knee To No Basis](http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2009/05/mystery-meat-knee-to-no-basis.html)

Meanwhile, this Passive Aggressive Note is probably the funniest thing i&#8217;ve seen since the [Bruno movie trailer](http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/bruno/international-red-band-trailer)&#8230;
