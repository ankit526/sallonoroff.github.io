Is it obvious that i&#8217;ve lost all enthusiasm for this experiment yet?

Numbers drawn: **08, 15, 19, 26, 33, 36** + bonus ball **01**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Next week&#8217;s draw will mark the half-way point of this experiment. Given this, I might provide some in-depth analysis of the results thus far. It&#8217;s quite likely that I won&#8217;t though. Sorry.

**Lottery balance: £-25  //  Not A Lottery balance: £25.03**
