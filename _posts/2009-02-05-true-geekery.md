It&#8217;s little more than a week until &#8220;UNIX&#8221; time will read 1234567890. Check the counter [here](http://coolepochcountdown.com/). You know you&#8217;re a geek if you find this even mildly interesting. Don&#8217;t worry if you couldn&#8217;t care less though &#8211; you&#8217;ll only have to put up with us until [2038](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). That&#8217;s when the world as we know it will end.
