It's little more than a week until &#8220;UNIX&#8221; time will read 1234567890. Check the counter [here](http://coolepochcountdown.com/). You know you're a geek if you find this even mildly interesting. Don't worry if you couldn't care less though &#8211; you'll only have to put up with us until [2038](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). That's when the world as we know it will end.
