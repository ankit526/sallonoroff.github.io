Oooooooh! The web is going speculation crazy over some [financial jiggery-pokery Microsoft announced](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/may09/05-11statement.mspx) on Monday that'll leave them about $4billion better off. Most folk assume they're prepping for some big takeover, the question just being choice of target.

The obvious action would be another attempt at taking search-engine Yahoo! but there's quite a [few](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1137293/microsoft-set) [folk](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/12/microsoft_not_buying_sap_debt_offering/) suggesting it'll be German software giant [SAP](http://www.sap.com/). [Some guess](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/12/msft-bond) it might be Blackberry-maker [RIM](http://www.rim.com/), while [others](http://blog.carpadium.com/?p=349) are even proposing Palm or Dell as targets. Meanwhile, [some clever dick reckons](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/11/AR2009051102632.html) that MS could, with their cash-Everest, probably afford to buy [The Walt Disney Company](http://corporate.disney.go.com/), [Time Warner](http://www.timewarner.com/corp/), Yahoo! _and_ Facebook without much stretching. I'm just surprised there's been no mention of them buying Twitter yet. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later (the rumour, not the takeover).

Anyway, it'd be remiss of me to not join in, so here's my own crazy speculation&#8230; **Microsoft will buy Skype**. Remember you read it here first, ladies and gents.
