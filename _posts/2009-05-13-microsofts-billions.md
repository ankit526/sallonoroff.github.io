Oooooooh! The web is going speculation crazy over some [financial jiggery-pokery Microsoft announced](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/may09/05-11statement.mspx) on Monday that&#8217;ll leave them about $4billion better off. Most folk assume they&#8217;re prepping for some big takeover, the question just being choice of target.

The obvious action would be another attempt at taking search-engine Yahoo! but there&#8217;s quite a [few](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1137293/microsoft-set) [folk](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/12/microsoft_not_buying_sap_debt_offering/) suggesting it&#8217;ll be German software giant [SAP](http://www.sap.com/). Some [guess](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/12/msft-bond) it might be Blackberry-maker [RIM](http://www.rim.com/) while [others](http://blog.carpadium.com/?p=349) are even proposing Palm or Dell as targets. Meanwhile, [some clever dick reckons](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/11/AR2009051102632.html) that MS could with their cash Everest probably afford to buy [The Walt Disney Company](http://corporate.disney.go.com/), [Time Warner](http://www.timewarner.com/corp/), Yahoo! _and _Facebook without much stretching. I&#8217;m just surprised there&#8217;s been no mention of them buying twitter yet. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll happen sooner or later (the rumour, not the takeover).

Anyway, it&#8217;d be remiss of me to not join in, so here&#8217;s my own crazy speculation&#8230; **Microsoft will buy Skype**. Remember you read it here first, ladies and gents.
