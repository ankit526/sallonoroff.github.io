Four or five years ago i realised that LEDs were the inevitable future of lighting and decided that if i wanted to make pots and pots of cash i should produce an LED bulb. Unfortunately I hadn't yet got around to that item on my to-do list and now it seems Philips have beaten me to it.[^fn-competition]

They've created [a range of LED lightbulbs](http://www.lighting.philips.com/gl_en/global_sites/lighting/master_led/general_accent_lighting.php) that use very little power (approx 7watts to produce a &#8220;45watt bulb&#8221; effect), last upto 45,000 hours (that's 5 years if you left it on permanently) and employ standard fittings. They're bound to be expensive (since you make a saving in the long-run) but this is one bulb you wouldn't want to hide behind a shade&#8230;

The [Core77 Blog](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/philips_leds_the_way_12817.asp) also details Philips' new &#8220;LivingColours&#8221; lamp which, through the use of primary-coloured LEDs, is capable of creating 16 million different colours. Presumably none of those 16 million will be black though.

[^fn-competition]: Damn those international corporations with their huge R&D budgets! How is a fat, lazy man from Northern England meant to compete with them?
