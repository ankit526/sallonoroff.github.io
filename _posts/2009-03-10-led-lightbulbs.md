Four or five years ago i realised that LEDs were the inevitable future of lighting and decided that if i wanted to make pots and pots of cash i should produce an LED bulb. Unfortunately I hadn&#8217;t yet got around to that item on my to-do list and now it seems Philips have beaten me to it (Damn those international corporations with their huge R&D budgets! How is a fat, lazy man from Northern England meant to compete with them?). They&#8217;ve created [a range of LED lightbulbs](http://www.lighting.philips.com/gl_en/global_sites/lighting/master_led/general_accent_lighting.php) that use very little power (approx 7watts to produce a &#8220;45watt bulb&#8221; effect), last upto 45,000 hours (that&#8217;s 5 years if you left it on permanently) and employ standard fittings. They&#8217;re bound to be expensive (since you make a saving in the long-run) but this is one bulb you wouldn&#8217;t want to hide behind a shade&#8230;

Presumably none of those 16 million will be black though.
