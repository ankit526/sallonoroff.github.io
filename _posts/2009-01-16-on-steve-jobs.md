What a big hoo-hah Mr Jobs has caused by [admitting his health problems are more complicated than originally thought](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/14advisory.html).

I've nothing original to add to the myriad of speculation and opinion already spouted other than to say I'm with [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/01/15/nocera) - the man is entitled to his privacy. He doesn't have to tell the public anything.

Oh, and about the most sensible take i've read since this all kicked off is [Cringley's](http://www.cringely.com/2009/01/don%E2%80%99t-worry-about-apple/). Steve Jobs will one day leave Apple for good, be it through retirement or death. That is inevitable. The worst period of Apple's history may have been the era without Jobs at the helm but that doesn't mean the company will go down the pan the second time it happens. That is NOT inevitable.
