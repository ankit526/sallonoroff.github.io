What a big hoo-hah Mr Jobs has caused by <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/14advisory.html" target="_blank">admitting his health problems are more complicated than originally thought</a>.

I&#8217;ve nothing original to add to the myriad of speculation and opinion already spouted other than to say I&#8217;m with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/01/15/nocera" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> &#8211; the man is entitled to his privacy. He doesn&#8217;t have to tell the public anything.

Oh, and about the most sensible take i&#8217;ve read since this all kicked off is <a href="http://www.cringely.com/2009/01/don%E2%80%99t-worry-about-apple/" target="_blank">Cringley&#8217;s</a>. Steve Jobs will one day leave Apple for good, be it through retirement or death. That is inevitable. The worst period of Apple&#8217;s history may have been the era without Jobs at the helm but that doesn&#8217;t mean the company &#8216;ll go down the pan the second time it happens. That is NOT inevitable.
