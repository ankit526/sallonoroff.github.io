At the other end of [this link](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/10/06/you_are_underestimating_the_future.html) is a video. It's of a man answering some questions from a roomful of computer programmers. It was shot 15 years ago, the video and audio quality is poor and it is over an hour long. Doesn't sound very appealing, does it?

Thing is, the man in question is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs giving honest and carefully considered answers (and opinions) to a crowd of the Mac faithful at the 1997 WWDC (shortly before he returned to Apple as CEO). I think it makes for compelling viewing.
