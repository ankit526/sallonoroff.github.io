[According to the FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e07b9166-fb94-11dd-bcad-000077b07658.html), ITV might be looking to flog Friends Reunited, with analysts predicting that potential suitors would &#8220;include rival sites such as Facebook and MySpace&#8221;.

Can i be the first to call &#8220;bollocks&#8221; on this?

Friends Reunited was arguably the first &#8220;social networking&#8221; website and a pretty decent idea back at the turn of the millennium, if only let-down (from the users point-of-view) by the charging of a fee to contact any old friends you'd found. By the time the company realised nobody liked this and made everything gratis, it was too late &#8211; Facebook, Bebo and MySpace had already taken hold. So Friends Reunited is now _just another_ site and almost certainly won't be bought by anyone who already has a foot in the social networking market.

My money is on ITV selling it (at a massive loss) to some relatively unknown outfit and the brand just disappearing completely within 6 months of the sale&#8230;
