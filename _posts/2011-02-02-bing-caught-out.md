[Here&#8217;s an amusing entry over on Google&#8217;s blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html), detailing how they&#8217;ve caught Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine copying their search results.

To be honest, it still surprises me to learn that some people use a search engine other than Google.
