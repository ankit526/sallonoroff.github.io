I've seen a fair bit of snarking in blogs and on twitter about the new [Dell XPS 15z](http://www.dell.com/uk/p/xps-15z/pd) and how remarkably similar it looks to Apple's [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro).

Which is fair enough &#8211; just look through Engadget's photo gallery in [their review of the XPS 15z](http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/dell-xps-15z-review/) &#8211; it _does_ look quite similar to the MacBook Pro. But, let's face it, it's not the first PC laptop to take &#8220;inspiration&#8221; from Apple's hardware, is it? And i don't believe it's even the worst offender. For me, [last year's HP Envy line-up](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/05/hp-envy-14-and-17-officially-official-envy-13-slowly-waves-good/) looked much more Apple-like than the Dell&#8230;
