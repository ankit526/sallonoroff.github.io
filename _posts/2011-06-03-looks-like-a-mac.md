I&#8217;ve seen a fair bit of snarking in blogs and on twitter about the new [Dell XPS 15z](http://www.dell.com/uk/p/xps-15z/pd) and how remarkably similar it looks to Apple&#8217;s [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256" title="xps15z" src="/images/fromwp/2011/06/xps15z.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 15z" width="400" height="267" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/06/xps15z.jpg 400w, /images/fromwp/2011/06/xps15z-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />

Which is fair enough &#8211; just look through Engadget&#8217;s photo gallery in [their review of the XPS 15z](http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/dell-xps-15z-review/) &#8211; it _does_ look quite similar to the MacBook Pro. But, let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not the first PC laptop to take &#8220;inspiration&#8221; from Apple&#8217;s hardware, is it? And i don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s even the worst offender. For me, [last year&#8217;s HP Envy line-up](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/05/hp-envy-14-and-17-officially-official-envy-13-slowly-waves-good/) looked much more Apple-like than the Dell&#8230;
