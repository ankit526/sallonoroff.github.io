Back in ye olden days i was a big fan of using special characters (via [Alt Codes](http://www.alt-codes.net/)) to produce pseudo-GUIs for my [PASCAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) programs but i&#8217;d never twigged that many of these characters are available in HTML too. Despite being a regular user of **_&nbsp;_** and **_&copy;_** i&#8217;d never thought that classics like ♦ ♣ ♥ ♠ would be there too. Yes, sometimes i am very slow.

Anyway, [here&#8217;s a very big list of the special characters available in HTML.](http://thegorillaguide.com/Ref_Special%20characters.html)

Enjoy. ☂
