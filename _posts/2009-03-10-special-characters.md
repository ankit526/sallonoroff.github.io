Back in ye olden days i was a big fan of using [alt codes](http://www.alt-codes.net/) to produce special characters that built pseudo-GUIs for my [PASCAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) programs but i'd never twigged that many of these characters would be available in HTML too. Despite being a regular user of `&nbsp;` and `&copy;` i'd never thought that classics like ♦ ♣ ♥ ♠ would be there too. Yes, sometimes i am very slow.

Anyway, [here's a very big list of the special characters available in HTML.](https://thegorillaguide.com/reference/html-special-characters)

Enjoy. ☂
