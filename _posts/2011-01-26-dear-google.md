_Dear Google, my husband and I have been married for 22 years. He is 47 and I am 44&#8230;_

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1128" title="Google, the agony aunt." src="/images/fromwp/2011/01/deargoogle.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/01/deargoogle.jpg 600w, /images/fromwp/2011/01/deargoogle-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Yes, apparently enough people use Google as an agony aunt for these to appear as suggested searches. OH EM GEE, as you might say.
