The entertainment retailer Zavvi, formerly known as Virgin Megastores, [went out of business in February](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7897506.stm) so i was a little surprised the other day when i received an email from [Zavvi.co.uk](http://www.zavvi.co.uk/) advertising the fact that they'd &#8220;bounced back&#8221;. Curious. I'd not seen anything about them getting a last minute reprieve or being bought-out by another company but then i checked in the small print of the message:

> _&#8220;Zavvi.co.uk is now owned and operated by the Hut Group&#8221;_

I don't think the Hut Group is a name many people would immediately recognise. It took a second but then i remembered a little online CD/DVD/Games retailer i'd once been told about. It was called The Hut. At the time I never took up the recommendation and probably dismissed it as yet another Amazon-wannabe &#8211; yet here they were years later buying themselves a ticket into the big leagues by acquiring a high street brand.

Only i don't think that's quite the case. You see, i visited [The Hut Group website](http://www.thehutgroup.com/) and it was immediately apparent these guys aren't quite the small fry i'd assumed. Not only does [TheHut.com](http://www.thehut.com/) still exist, but the company also runs [SendIt.com](http://www.sendit.com/) (another site i'd labelled as a Amazon-wannabe in the past) and, more impressively, the online retail operations (for CDs, DVDs, Books and Games, at least) for ASDA, Co-op and Tesco. Sure the purchase of the Zavvi name gives the company a recognised brand to work from&#8230; but this wasn't the &#8220;big break&#8221; i thought it was, rather a nice bit of expansion.

And if that expansion allows them to start competing with [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) and [Play.com](http://www.play.com/) on price, I'm more than happy to give them a whirl&#8230;
