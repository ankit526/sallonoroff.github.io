The world has lost a great, great man. I don't recall ever shedding a tear over the death of a complete stranger before yesterday. Rest In Peace, Steve.

**Update:** In the sea of online obituaries and tributes, i thought [Stephen Fry's](http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs/single-page/) piece stood out as rather good. And i liked [Horace Dediu's](http://www.asymco.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-didnt/) style too.
