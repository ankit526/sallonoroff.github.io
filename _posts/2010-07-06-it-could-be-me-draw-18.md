Here we go again. You know the score by now&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **08, 31, 37, 43, 44, 48** + bonus ball **14**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Again, just one number matched. Very disappointing. Meanwhile, the Not A Lottery bank account accrues another penny in interest. GOAL!

**Lottery balance: £-18  //  Not A Lottery balance: £18.02**
