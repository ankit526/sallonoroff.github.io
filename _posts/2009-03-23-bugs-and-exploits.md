There's a very interesting [Q&A over at ZDnet with Charlie Miller](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2941), the &#8220;researcher&#8221; who exploited Safari on OSX in the recent Pwn2Own contest. Charlie says that OSX is by far the easiest operating system to write exploits for since it employs no anti-exploit measures. _Gulp_. Of course, you need to find a bug before you can write an exploit and even then exploits tend to require some user-input, but this should still make for pretty chilling reading for Mac-users.

Sadly i think the majority of Mac owners who do find this piece will just choose to dismiss it and i doubt that (m)any Apple-oriented websites will pick-up on the article anyway&#8230;
