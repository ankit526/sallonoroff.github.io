Since i got a MacBook, i have not been able to use a PC laptop trackpad without thinking the thing is broken. That is how natural i find the &#8220;multi-touch&#8221; two-finger scrolling gesture of Apple&#8217;s notebooks. The traditional but cumbersome click-with-your-thumb-then-scroll-with-index-finger manoeuvre of PC trackpads is quickly forgotten once you&#8217;ve spent even a little time with the MacBook. (No really, it is. My very-non-technical, very-non-apple-fan wife now even complains that the PC trackpad &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work properly&#8221;)

Thus i was _very_ pleased to [discover](http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/19/synaptics-driver-enables-multitouch-gestures-on-older-trackpads/) that the latest [Synaptics](http://www.synaptics.com/) trackpad drivers incorporate two-finger scrolling, and even more so that it is supported on older hardware. Yep, if you find yourself stuck with a PC laptop at work but it uses a Synaptics &#8216;pad, you should be able to add some two-finger scrolling goodness. _Hallelujah!_

[Download the WindowsXP drivers here](ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp47501-48000/sp47816.exe). (I can confirm that this update just enabled two-finger scrolling on a 5 year old Dell Latitude X300)
