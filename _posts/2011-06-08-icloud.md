I maintain that i won't write about iCloud properly until i've experienced it first hand but here are couple of articles about it that i've found very interesting.

First up, we have [Cringely making some bold statements](http://www.cringely.com/2011/06/iclouds-real-purpose-is-to-kill-windows/) about what Apple's announcements mean for Microsoft, Google, Apple and customer data.

Then there's [this piece by Cade Metz at The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/07/from_mobileme_to_icloud/), similarly discussing what iCloud means for the future of our data.
