The Apple rumour-mill has been working overtime lately with [tales](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/03/11/apple-netbook-touchscreen-rumors-continue-to-gather-steam/) [of](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/20/more-apple-netbook-rumors-pinpoint-foxconn-as-manufacturer/) [netbooks](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/22/apple-questioned-again-about-a-mac-netbook/), which have in the last few days developed into talk of [Mac tablets (again) and diet iPhones](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/27/two-new-devices-from-apple-category-defining-media-pad-and-iphone-lite/). Personally, i don&#8217;t see an Apple netbook, in the Eee-sense at least, ever happening but a Macintosh tablet is something might have legs. Especially if it was anything like Craig Hockenberry&#8217;s &#8220;[Front Row To Go](http://furbo.org/2009/03/16/front-row-to-go/)&#8221; suggestion &#8211; a device that _compliments_ your iPhone/iPod Touch and Macintosh, rather than something that might be bought _instead_ of them. IÂ particularly like the idea of such a device acting as a peripheral &#8211; for your iPod, iPhone or AppleTV it provides a large, touchscreen keyboard while for a desktop it provides multi-touch input.

There is, however, one small problem with the &#8220;Front Row To Go&#8221; which Hockenberry even points it out himself&#8230;

> _selling a bigger touch device could cut into iPhone sales: keep your crappy cell phone and buy the netbook to throw in your purse or backpack._

Yep, the tablet would compliment your iPhone and Mac nicely _if_ you already have both. If you&#8217;re a Mac-user without an iPhone though, it may well become an either-or decision. Pricing may be more critical than ever.
