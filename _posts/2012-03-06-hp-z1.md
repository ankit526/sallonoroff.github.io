Thanks to [Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/hps_z1_workstation_designed_so_you_can_mess_with_it_21770.asp) for bringing to my attention the new all-in-one, 27-inch [Z1 workstation](http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/workstations/z1_features.html) from HP. It&#8217;s sort of iMac meets Mac Pro meets manufacturer who&#8217;s happy for you to tinker&#8230;
