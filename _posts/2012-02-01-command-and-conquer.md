Command and Conquer playable in your web browser? Sure, no probs, [here you go](http://www.adityaravishankar.com/projects/games/command-and-conquer/).

(Yes, yes, it&#8217;s just a single mission demo but IT IS WRITTEN IN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. Do you not understand? This is AMAZING.)

PS. Did you know that C&C: Tiberian Dawn and C&C: Red Alert were released as freeware by EA a while back? [Lovely](http://www.cncforums.com/new/local_links.php?catid=66) [stuff](http://www.cncforums.com/new/local_links.php?catid=56).
