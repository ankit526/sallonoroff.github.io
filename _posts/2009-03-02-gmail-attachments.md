Each time i attach a huge file to a message in Gmail i curse Google for not having some sort of indicator of how your upload is progressing&#8230; But not today. No, today i smiled. I smiled a great big thank-you-google-geeks smile because gmail now has an upload progress bar for your attachments. Huzzah!

Having since checked the [gmail blog](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/), it seems they&#8217;ve also added support for [multiple selections](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/updates-to-attachments-multi-select-and.html) for attachments. Another minor grievance bites the dust.
