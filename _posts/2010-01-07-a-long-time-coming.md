Rumours of a &#8220;tablet&#8221; Macintosh have been floating around for nearly a decade now but the whispers circulating about what we all now think of as _The_ Apple Tablet (or iSlate, or whatever) actually began in earnest around [April](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/11/steve-jobs-also-overseeing-apple-tablet-or-netbook-device/) [2009](http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/27/two-new-devices-from-apple-category-defining-media-pad-and-iphone-lite/). That's nearly a year of rumour, hype, speculation and commentary ([myself included](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/04/the-device-between-iphone-and-mac/)) with absolutely no evidence of anything new actually being developed by the boys and girls in Cupertino. Yet here we are in 2010 still at it, with [the very latest rumours](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/04/apple-tablet-scheduled-to-begin-shipping-in-march-two-different-material-casings-being-considered/) suggesting that an announcement is mere weeks away and that the most-eagerly anticipated Apple device since the iPhone will be available to buy come March.

Appetites are wet. There's a feeling that something is coming. It's fine to get excited&#8230; But tablets with pico-projectors? C'mon now, settle down at the back. I think we need to read two of the more sensible evaluations of this whole situation&#8230;

Step forward [Mr Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet). Step forward [Mr Siracusa](http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2010/01/antacid-tablet.ars).

**Update:** John Gruber has posted another piece on the rumoured Apple tablet. [Clicky](http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/tablet_musings).

**Update #2:** Lots more reasonable and thoughtful &#8220;predictions&#8221; appearing on the web now, so you may also be interested to read the views of [Aaron Mahnke](http://aaronmahnke.com/2009/12/23/apples-tablet-device/) and [Neven](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/318412000/diy) [Mrgan](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/323938510/diy-pt-ii). I'm particular taken by [Tim VanDamme's prediction](http://maxvoltar.com/archive/dreaming-of-an-apple-tablet), though the product he describes (illustrated with some wonderfully simple diagrams) sounds/looks very much like something that i &#8220;invented&#8221; a while ago (see &#8220;The MacBook-style iPod/iPhone Dock&#8221; [in this blog entry from August 2009](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/shiny-new-apple-products/)).
