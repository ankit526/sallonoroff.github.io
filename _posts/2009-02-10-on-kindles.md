Amazon [yesterday announced](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/02/09/kindle_2/) a new version of their Kindle electronic book reader thingy-ma-jig and my word does it look improved. The fugly angular look is out and replaced by lovely iPod-esque curves and metal(-look?) back plate. Indeed, Amazon also appear to be borrowing Apple&#8217;s promo photography style &#8211; solid white or black backgrounds and semi-reflective floors. Someone definitely sees this device as the iPod of reading.

Anywho, aside from the aesthetic improvements it&#8217;s now lighter, thinner, has more storage space, sports a crisper display and has improved battery life (upto 4 days apparently). Most impressive for me though is the Automatic Library Backup feature&#8230; That is to say that Amazon remembers what you&#8217;ve bought (of course) and allows you to download those books again for free if you ever need to. Now that is the sort of &#8220;fair play&#8221; common sense that i like to see. Such a shame that these days we&#8217;ve started to expect to have to pay for all our digital content again if it&#8217;s ever lost.

I&#8217;d very much like to try out a Kindle and see first-hand what they&#8217;re like to read from and use. Sadly that won&#8217;t be happening any time soon for a couple of reasons. 1) You can&#8217;t get them in the UK. Amazon intend to sell the Kindle 2  internationally &#8211; but have no date for that yet. And 2) I certainly won&#8217;t be buying one even if they were available here as they&#8217;re far too expensive. The US RRP of $359 equates to about £240 which is dear enough &#8211; but you know it&#8217;d end up being more than that here. I guess something like £299 if/when it does go on sale. No thanks. Especially when the Kindle &#8220;books&#8221; aren&#8217;t substantially cheaper than the physical paper copy. But then i probably had much the same feelings towards the original iPod.
