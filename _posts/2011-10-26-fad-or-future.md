I'm not sure why i've never blogged about [Lytro](http://www.lytro.com/) before because the company has been on my radar from some months now and what they're doing in the world of photography could be **huge**. Perhaps it was that until last week they were only promising magic &#8211; now they're offering it up for sale. Take a look at the [Lytro Light Field Camera](http://www.lytro.com/camera).

Odd-looking, no? And quite expensive too at $399 for a camera with only 2 buttons and a fixed 8GB capacity. So what's the big deal? Well, this thing captures images that can be re-focused _later_. Yes, later. Afterwards. AFTER THE FACT. You just take photos and adjust the focus to your heart's content when you've downloaded them to a computer. It's quite incredible stuff. Go and take a look at the examples in Lytro's [gallery](http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures). And if you want to try and understand how this thing works then check out their [explanation here](http://www.lytro.com/science_inside).

This tech could be future of photography. Or it could just be another passing fad.Â I can't wait to see some real-world reviews and find out which it might be&#8230;
