I&#8217;m not sure why i&#8217;ve never blogged about [Lytro](http://www.lytro.com/) before because the company has been on my radar from some months now and what they&#8217;re doing in the world of photography could be **huge**. Perhaps it was that until last week they were only promising magic &#8211; now they&#8217;re offering it up for sale. Take a look at the [Lytro Light Field Camera](http://www.lytro.com/camera).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1426" title="lytro camera" src="/images/fromwp/2011/10/lytro-camera.jpg" alt="Lytro Camera" width="400" height="324" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/10/lytro-camera.jpg 400w, /images/fromwp/2011/10/lytro-camera-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />

Odd-looking, no? And quite expensive too at $399 for a camera with only 2 buttons and a fixed 8GB capacity. So what&#8217;s the big deal? Well, this thing captures images that can be re-focused _later_. Yes, later. Afterwards. AFTER THE FACT. You just take photos and adjust the focus to your heart&#8217;s content when you&#8217;ve downloaded them to a computer. It&#8217;s quite incredible stuff. Go and take a look at the examples in Lytro&#8217;s [gallery](http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures). And if you want to try and understand how this thing works then check out their [explanation here](http://www.lytro.com/science_inside).

This tech could be future of photography. Or it could just be another passing fad.Â I can&#8217;t wait to see some real-world reviews and find out which it might be&#8230;
