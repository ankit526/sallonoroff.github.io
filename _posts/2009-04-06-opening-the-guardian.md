The Guardian [opened](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/10/guardian-open-platform) it's archives to the world through the &#8220;[Open Platform](http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform)&#8221; APIs less than a month ago but already it's creating some interesting results.

First up, for those of us who love profanity, there's an [analysis of swearies used in the paper](http://www.tomhume.org/2009/04/tracking-uk-liberal-indecency.html). Clearly the Guardian needs to work harder on including &#8220;wank&#8221; in its output.

And secondly, take a look at the [Guardian Trends](http://guardiantrends.appspot.com/) app that allows you to compare how often things feature in Guardian articles. The apps author uses Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton as his default example graph&#8230; but you can do anything. Such as [Steve Jobs vs Bill Gates](http://guardiantrends.appspot.com/?q=%22steve+jobs%22%2C+%22bill+gates%22&months=12).

It'll be interesting to see what else can be created with this&#8230;
