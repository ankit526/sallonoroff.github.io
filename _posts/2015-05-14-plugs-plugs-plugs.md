Regularly viewers will know that [I have a bit of a thing](/blog/tags#plug) for the British electric plug. Today a friend asked me to dig out the [URL](http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/plug-versus-plug/) of a CNET article [I once linked-to](/blog/2012/05/the-great-british-plug/) and it reminded me that i've been meaning to post this video for ages. It's excellent. And was the piece of evidence I used to finally persuade my wife to stop using those [stupid plastic &#8220;safety&#8221; socket covers](http://www.fatallyflawed.org.uk). Enjoy, domestic electrical system fans!

Makes you proud, doesn't it Britain? God bless the Queen, and all who sail in her.

Now, while I'm here writing about plugs I can't go without mentioning the recent excitement about Apple's new USB charger for the UK. What's the excitement? Well, it has folding pins. Yes, FOLDING PINS! A few years ago [I wondered](/blog/2012/03/folding-plug/) if Apple might licence the design of the excellent Mu folding plug but it turns out they'd rather just make [their own](http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MGRL2B/A/apple-5w-usb-power-adapter-folding-pins). What a beautiful, beautiful thing. Thank you Sir Jony.
