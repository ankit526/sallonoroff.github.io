So, the penultimate ICBM draw.

Numbers drawn: **06, 16, 26, 32, 34, 46** ****+ bonus ball **33**

My Numbers: **05, 06, 14, 24, 40, 41**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Nope, nothing. Though rather annoyingly if i had still been playing the same set of numbers that i&#8217;d started the experiment with (06, 09, 16, 23, 27, 32) then i&#8217;d now be celebrating a £10 win. And the opposing balances wouldn&#8217;t look like this&#8230;

**Lottery balance: -£51.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £51.12**
