For those of you who haven&#8217;t been paying attention, the PC market is currently trying to combat Apple&#8217;s rather-very-successful MacBook Air range of laptops with their own thin, lightweight portables, AKA &#8220;Ultrabooks&#8221;. Unfortunately the Ultrabooks released to date haven&#8217;t really cut the mustard. PC manufacturers can match technical spec, they can do small and lightweight no problem, and some of them are getting good at making aesthetically-pleasing, well-built machines, but they are seemingly incapable of putting this all together in a package that bests (or even just matches) Apple&#8217;s pricing*.

But it looks like Dell are set to change all that with the release of [the XPS 13](http://www.dell.com/html/global/xps13/xps-13-ultrabook.html).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1572" title="XPS 13" src="/images/fromwp/2012/02/dellxps13.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13" width="500" height="288" srcset="/images/fromwp/2012/02/dellxps13.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2012/02/dellxps13-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

Here&#8217;s a aluminium-topped, carbon-fibre bodied laptop which squeezes a 13-inch screen onto a 12-inch laptop chassis and sports an Intel Core i5 chip, 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. Sure this thin-and-light design has sacrificed a few ports ([some](http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/10/dells-xps-13-ultrabook-announced/) may complain) but that hasn&#8217;t stopped people buying similarly afflicted MacBook Airs. It&#8217;s a very good-looking bit of kit and [apparently](http://technologizer.com/2012/01/11/dell-xps-13/) impeccably built, but best of all it has [just gone on sale](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/27/2828576/dell-xps-13-ultrabook-shipping-date) in the US for $999. That&#8217;s a price that&#8217;s sure to stop some people buying Apple hardware to run Windows on.

* Do you need an example? OK, have this. The snappily-named [Toshiba Portégé Z830-104](http://uk.computers.toshiba-europe.com/innovation/series/Portege-Z830-Series/1112901/) is a decent-looking, magnesium alloy-clad ultrabook with innards as good as identical to the 13-inch MacBook Air and yet it retails in the UK for over £200 more. So much for Apple products being expensive.
