![Dell Adamo XPS Notebook](/images/fromwp/2009/11/adamo-xps.jpg)

Say hello to the [Dell Adamo XPS](http://www.adamobydell.com/xps/).

Dell have been teasing tech journos with titbits for a while now, but they've [finally revealed everything](http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/05/dell-adamo-xps-coming-in-time-for-the-holidays-for-1799-unbo/) and announced the machine will be available (in the US, at least) before Christmas. The specs turn out to be &#8220;the usual&#8221; for a laptop that is so very, very thin (1.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, GS45 integrated graphics, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, no optical drive and Windows7) but it does have a couple of special tricks. The first and most obvious is that uniquely positioned hinge. The hardware is kept as slim as possible by having the body drop out of the &#8220;lid&#8221; half and by mounting the hinge part-way up the machine, the Dell designers have gifted the user both an elevated keyboard position and an in-built &#8220;laptop cooler&#8221;. The other piece of &#8220;fancy&#8221; employed by the Adamo XPS is the screen latch &#8211; there is no physical switch, button or latch but rather section of the lid is touch-sensitive and pops open when stroked. Geek heaven.

Sadly, this geek isn't taken in by the Adamo XPS. First off, i'd be too worried about that electronic latch system failing &#8211; it wouldn't be too hard to envisage a situation where you can't get the thing to open, or indeed keep it closed. Also, how do you use this laptop atop your lap with its strange design? I mean, it'd be _possible_ but would it actually be comfortable for any stretch of time? I can't imagine so. Finally, for a machine carrying the Adamo badge, it shares little styling with the original [Adamo](http://www.adamobydell.com/) and, i think, looks very cheap by comparison. [I wasn't too enamoured with the original Adamo](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/adamo-by-dell/) but the XPS makes that computer looks like design gold.

Dell must be applauded for trying to do things a little bit differently to the rest of the Windows PC market but on this occasion i'm not convinced.

**Update:** Not sure how it was possible, but I forgot to mention the Adamo XPS' _claimed_ battery life is a little over two and a half hours. We all know how to take manufacturer's battery life claims with a pinch of salt. So, what can we expect in the real world? About 2 hours? Pathetic.

**Update #2:** It seems Dell had some other fancy ideas for the Adamo XPS. See [SlashGear's report](http://www.slashgear.com/dell-adamo-xps-prototypes-played-with-multitouch-trackpads-touch-sensitive-keyboards-more-0663053/) on the prototypes.
