I've wanted to create a simple online photo gallery for a while now but, being lazy, i needed something that required minimal effort to make and update. I thought i might try and write some PHP that automatically generated a webpage of clickable thumbnails based on the contents of a given folder &#8230;but thankfully i found some people that'd already done just that. I love the Internet.

Say hello to these wonderful little bits of code:

[sye.dk/sfpg](http://sye.dk/sfpg/)

[davidwalsh.name/generate-photo-gallery](http://davidwalsh.name/generate-photo-gallery)

I settled on sfpg as it required least effort (though neither are particularly difficult to get working) &#8211; just drop a PHP file into the directory of images and you're away. It could not be simpler &#8211; you're up and running in seconds (though I hacked at the code a little bit in order to hide some functions that i didn't want available, which took me much, much longer than a few seconds).
