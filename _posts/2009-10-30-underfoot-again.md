You may recall that a few weeks ago [i revealed](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/10/underfoot/) my idea to generate electricity by harnessing human foot-falls but also how the [POWERleap](http://www.powerleap.net/) project had beaten me to it (unsurprisingly). Well today [i discovered](http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/10/28/energy-generating-pavement/) i was doubly unoriginal, as somebody else is doing the same sort of thing. Say hello to British company [Pavegen Systems Ltd](http://www.pavegensystems.com/), who already have test sites out in London.

This idea must have legs[^fn-badjoke].

[^fn-badjoke]: Don't you dare groan.
