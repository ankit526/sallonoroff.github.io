Restoring a computer from a saved image of the hard drive is pure magic. Technical wizardry. Geek sorcery. There are plenty of commercial programs for doing this but i'd always struggled to find decent free tool&#8230; until now. [PING](http://ping.windowsdream.com/) is the first free partition imaging program i've tried that is simple to follow and straight-forward to use. That's not to say it's novice-friendly but anyone that understands &#8220;partitions&#8221; should be able to create a backup of their system in no time[^fn-sometime].

[^fn-sometime]: Obviously some time _is_ required, smartarse. Testing PING i imaged a 40GB disk in under 30 minutes and the restoration took around 10.
