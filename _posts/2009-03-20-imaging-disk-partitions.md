Restoring a computer from a saved image of the hard drive is pure magic. Technical wizardry. Geek sorcery. There are plenty of commercial programs for doing this but i&#8217;d always struggled to find decent free tool&#8230; until now. [PING](http://ping.windowsdream.com/) is the first free partition imaging program i&#8217;ve tried that is simple to follow and straight-forward to use. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s novice-friendly but anyone that understands &#8220;partitions&#8221; should be able to create a backup of their system in no time*.

* Obviously some time _is_ required, smartarse. Testing PING i imaged a 40GB disk in under 30 minutes and the restoration took around 10.
