Upon seeing the new [Retina Display MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/) for the first time [my immediate thought](https://twitter.com/sallonoroff/statuses/229608612476100608) was that the display looked even better than those of the iPhone and iPad. Given that the iOS devices have higher DPI screens though, i sort of dismissed this thought as an impossibility. However, [in his latest post &#8211; which is all about pixels &#8211; John Gruber offers an answer as to why the MacBook Pro screen looks better](http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/pixel_perfect)&#8230;

> _One conclusion I’ve made in the weeks I’ve been using this machine: sub-pixel anti-aliasing matters. iOS doesn’t offer sub-pixel anti-aliasing; Mac OS X does. And I believe it’s one reason on-screen text looks even better on the retina MacBook Pro than it does on the ostensibly higher-resolution iPad and iPhone._

So the Mac makes up for a lower DPI display by employing some neat tricks. Well, I can confirm that they most definitely work &#8211; the new MacBook display is stunning.
