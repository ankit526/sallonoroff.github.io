In his [third piece](http://www.cringely.com/2009/02/the-bentonville-mafia/) on &#8220;fixing Microsoft&#8221; Bob Cringely has some convincing theories about those proposed Microsoft retail outlets &#8211; namely that it's all about providing street-level positive spin for Windows 7.

Sadly the rest of the article, dealing with the specifics of where he'd make cuts at MS, is a little too uneducated and thus disappointingly unconvincing. Not very Cringely, in fact.
