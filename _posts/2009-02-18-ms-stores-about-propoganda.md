In his [third piece](http://www.cringely.com/2009/02/the-bentonville-mafia/) <span>on &#8220;fixing Microsoft&#8221; Bob <span>Cringely</span> has some convincing theories about those proposed Microsoft retail outlets &#8211; namely that it&#8217;s all about providing street-level positive spin for Windows 7.</span>

<span>Sadly the rest of the article, dealing with the specifics of where he&#8217;d make cuts at MS, is a little too uneducated and thus disappointingly unconvincing. Not very Cringely, in fact.</span>
