I&#8217;ve just seen this [Cult Of Mac article](http://www.cultofmac.com/facenow-allows-you-to-place-facetime-calls-on-your-iphone-4-without-a-voice-call/61070) highlighting a new iPhone app called [FaceNow](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facenow-go-straight-into-facetime/id379980390?mt=8). The app&#8217;s purpose is to allow you to make FaceTime calls directly without having to switch to FaceTime after first making the connection via a voice call.

The thing is, you can do this anyway. Just press the FaceTime button on your chosen contact&#8217;s entry. In fact, i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ve made a FaceTime call yet by switching from a voice call. An utterly pointless app (which is hard to believe Apple have approved given their stance on feature duplication) and an utterly idiotic bit of blogging by Cult of Mac. Odd that they&#8217;d let someone that has clearly never used FaceTime write posts about it.
