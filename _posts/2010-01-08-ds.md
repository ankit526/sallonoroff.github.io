DS. Dual Screens. Nintendo [did it first](http://www.nintendo.com/ds), but the future will see plenty of other devices incorporate this feature. You may recall [my idea](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/08/shiny-new-apple-products/). You may recall [Sony&#8217;s concept](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/10/all-panel-laptop/). Well, now [MSI have joined the party](http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2010/01/08/msi-dual-screen-notebook-sighted/)&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" title="MSI-Dual-Screen" src="/images/fromwp/2010/01/MSI-Dual-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="250" srcset="/images/fromwp/2010/01/MSI-Dual-Screen.jpg 400w, /images/fromwp/2010/01/MSI-Dual-Screen-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />

I _love_ the future.
