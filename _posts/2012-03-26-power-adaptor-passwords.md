[The Register covers](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/09/apple_power_adapter_password_recovery/) the discovery of a patent awarded to Apple for the concept of storing password info in power adapters. It'sÂ definitely an interesting idea but i can't help but feel it's more than a little flawed.
