[The Register covers](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/09/apple_power_adapter_password_recovery/) the discovery of a patent awarded to Apple for the concept of storing password info in power adapters. It&#8217;sÂ definitely an interesting idea but i can&#8217;t help but feel it&#8217;s more than a little flawed.
