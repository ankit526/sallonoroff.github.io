[Yesterday i posted](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2012/10/i-have-opinions-on-most-things-so/) a link to a great video of Steve Jobs talking technology. Today, on the 1st anniversary of his death, i'm posting this [video](http://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc) of his [2005 Stanford Commencement Address](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html), in which he talks about life.

Yes, you've probably seen it before. I don't care. I think it's massively (re-)watchable and an inspiring speech. The bit that really resonates with me is towards the end:

> _&#8230; For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: &#8220;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?&#8221; And whenever the answer has been &#8220;No&#8221; for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something._

Everytime i watch/hear/read this I wish i had the fucking balls to live by the same sort of rule. And then almost immediately afterwards think, how can i afford not to? (Yet I change nothing. I'm an idiot.)

**PS.** There&#8217;s a beautiful tribute up on [apple.com](http://apple.com/) today.
