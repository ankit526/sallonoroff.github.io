You&#8217;ve found a video on Youtube that you&#8217;d like to download to watch later offline. Or maybe you want to save a copy of a YouTube video for posterity. Or perhaps you uploaded a clip to YouTube and no longer have the original but want one. So, how do you do that? Well, there are hundreds of free programs, websites and browser toolbars, add-ons, add-ins and extensions that purport to help you do this. The problem with the majority of these is that they&#8217;re plain useless if you&#8217;re lucky and serve-up [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) if you&#8217;re not.

Fortunately, there&#8217;s a fairly simple way to do it using just your web browser of choice and the free, open-source, cross-platform and generally awesome [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/):

  * Copy the URL of the YouTube video you&#8217;re wanting to save
  * Start VLC and go to &#8220;Open Network&#8230;&#8221;
  * Paste in the youtube link, then click Open
  * The video will start playing. Pause it and go to the media information window
  * The &#8220;Location&#8221; field should contain a (long, complicated looking) URL &#8211; this is a link to the actual video file &#8211; copy it
  * Now go back to your browser, paste that URL into the address bar and hit enter
  * You have video! (depending on browser used the file will either ask to be saved or start playing automatically, in which case you can just do File > Save As)

I&#8217;m not sure what the container and video format are of these saved files are yet but they play happily enough in VLC. It would be nice to know though &#8211; please let me know if you work it out!

The other limitation of this method that you should be aware of is that there&#8217;s no way choosing video quality &#8211; again, shout up if you know how to get at one of the particular qualities that YouTube has stored.

If the above looks too convoluted for you, then you might try [youtubeinmp4.com](http://youtubeinmp4.com/), which, despite being covered in ads and looking a bit dodgy, does appear to do something extremely similar but makes the process as simple as pasting in the YouTube link. I&#8217;ve grabbed a few videos using the site and, as far as I can tell, not caught anything nasty. Your mileage may vary, of course. Obviously you should take precautions before visiting the site, just in case.

**Update:** Alternatively, [saveitoffline.com](http://www.saveitoffline.com) looks like an even better website to try if you don&#8217;t fancy the VLC option. Just paste in the vid URL and you&#8217;re presented with links to all the various formats and qualities that YouTube has available for that clip. I&#8217;m not sure you could want for more.
