According to [a post over at Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/touch-sensitive_wall_paint_that_can_trigger_the_lights_18345.asp), some clever French gentlemen have developed and patented a paint and electronics system that will mean you never again need fumble around in the dark for a physical light switch, you just simply touch the wall to illuminate a room.

Incredible stuff. There are few details on how it works (naturally) but i'm already envisaging a future where you can dim or brighten the lighting in a room simply by using an iPhone-esque pinch gesture on the nearest surface. Though i suppose you'd only need that if you weren't already controlling all aspects of your home's electronics from an iPhone/iPad-like device anyway.
