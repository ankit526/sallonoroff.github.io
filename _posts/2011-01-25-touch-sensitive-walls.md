According to [a post over at Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/touch-sensitive_wall_paint_that_can_trigger_the_lights_18345.asp), some clever French gentlemen have developed and patented a paint and electronics system that will mean you never again need fumble around in the dark for a physical light switch, you just simply touch the wall to illuminate a room.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1119" title="Magic paint" src="/images/fromwp/2011/01/onoffpaint.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="395" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/01/onoffpaint.jpg 525w, /images/fromwp/2011/01/onoffpaint-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />

Incredible stuff. There are few details on how it works (naturally) but i&#8217;m already envisaging a future where you can dim or brighten the lighting in a room simply by using an iPhone-esque pinch gesture on the nearest surface. Though i suppose you&#8217;d only need that if you weren&#8217;t already controlling all aspects of your home&#8217;s electronics from an iPhone/iPad-like device anyway.
