Just ended up on Comedian (or would he prefer the title of Statistician?) Dave Gorman's blog and was given a reminder of just how good he can be thanks to [this post](http://gormano.blogspot.com/2009/02/we-now-sell-gravy.html). Superb.

On a more serious note, Mr Gorman is also [pointing](http://gormano.blogspot.com/2009/02/some-bad-science.html) people towards [Dr Ben Goldacre's Bad Science blog post(s)](http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/) on the hoo-hah caused by trying to shoot down some of the hysterical bullshit surrounding the MMR vaccination in the UK.
