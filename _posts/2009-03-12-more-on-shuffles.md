Following on from yesterday's [post](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/03/when-small-is-too-small/) about the new iPod Shuffle, it seems that Apple intend to sell a new adapter accessory for the device which will allow you to use 3rd party headphones or connect up to speakers, etc. At least that's what [Engadget has been told](http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/11/new-ipod-shuffle-requires-extra-adapter-for-third-party-headphon/). Presumably it'll just be a length of cable with 3.5mm jack on one end, new remote in the middle and a 3.5mm socket at the other end.

More opinion and analysis of the new Shuffle design can be found [here at MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/139333/2009/03/ipod_shuffle_design.html), [here at MacWorld again](http://www.macworld.com/article/139345/2009/03/shuffle_reaction.html) (with another mention of the Apple adapter), [here at BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/03/the_new_ipod_sh.html) and [here on the GartenBlog](http://gartenblog.net/2009/03/11/new-ipod-shuffle-defies-race-to-the-bottom-first-take/). If you're interesed in this topic then these are all worth a reading in full, but i just want to highlight this paragraph in Dan Moren's MacWorld piece&#8230;

> _&#8220;The new iPod shuffle takes a step back in both the usability and compatibility departments. Don’t get me wrong, the new VoiceOver feature is a very clever idea, especially on a device with no screen. But the rest of the changes make me wonder if Apple has placed too high a premium on the product's form over its function.&#8221;_

&#8230;which i couldn't agree with more. It's like Apple felt compelled to change it despite having almost achieved perfection with the 2nd gen. I also want to quote Dan's colleague Christopher Breen&#8230;

> _&#8220;But I’m not the target buyer for this device. If you walk along any city street, ride a subway or bus, or wander through the local gym, you’ll see that nearly everyone uses the stock Apple earbuds. It’s not that their ears are any more ideal for these things than mine, it’s just that most people don’t care or know any better._ **_This is what I got, this is what I’ll use_.**_&#8220;_

Yep, it's true. I was one of them until very [recently](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/02/on-headphones/). Only now i've been convinced that 3rd-party 'phones are better, Apple are going to tax me for using them if i buy a new Shuffle. _So what?_ i hear you say. _You've just admitted you're no longer the target market so stop complaining and buy a better iPod!_ come the cries. Well, yes, except that i bloody _love_ the Shuffle. It suits my needs perfectly. I have a 1st gen Shuffle and a 1st gen Nano, and while i might use the Nano once or twice a month, i use the Shuffle almost daily. Hit &#8220;Autofill&#8221; in iTunes, unplug, stick it on shuffle, drop it in a pocket and enjoy. If i want to skip the song that happens to come on or adjust the volume, i can reach into my pocket (or sometimes feel through clothing for the raised circular control) and press the required button without even looking at the thing. So much quicker than messing with a Hold switch and adjusting a scroll-wheel (as beautiful an experience as that is). I don't want or need a better iPod &#8211; the Shuffle is, or _was_, ideal.

Personally, i'm hoping sales of the new Shuffle aren't quite what Apple estimates and they end up including this new adapter in the box. And also that my four year old Shuffle doesn't pack-in before then.
