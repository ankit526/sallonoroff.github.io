There are only two ways you can try to fit the ubiquitous USB plug into its corresponding port and, because of the internals, only one way around will lead to a successful docking. IE, you have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. And yet I almost always get it wrong on the first attempt.

I&#8217;d really, really, really, really, really like it if one of you could make [this concept](http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/26/double-usb-concept-ends-your-fear-of-usb-plug-rejection/) into a reality please. Thank you.
