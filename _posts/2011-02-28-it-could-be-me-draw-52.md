Numbers drawn: **06, 08, 20, 29, 34, 36** + bonus ball **43**

Yay! A big fat nothing again. One year&#8217;s worth of saturday National Lottery draws and not a penny won. Evidence, if you should need it, that your money is better off in the bank. I&#8217;ll probably undertake some &#8220;analysis&#8221; of this experiment and provide you with a conclusion. Sometime. Anyway, after a year, this is how the final balances compare…

**Lottery balance: -£52.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £52.14**
