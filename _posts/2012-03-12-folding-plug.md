Do you remember Min-Kyu Choi's folding plug design from a couple of years back?

No?! Shame on you. It was a phenomenal bit of work. Look, here's his original [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6DvjKkGT6s) that went just a little bit viral. I'll wait while you watch it[^fn-alternatively].

Memory-refreshed? Right, well, after placing 3rd in the James Dyson Award 2009, taking a gold medal in the 2009 International Design Excellence Awards and winning Designs of the Year Product Award and Design of the Year at the Brit Insurance Design Awards 2010, Min-Kyu formed [Made In Mind](http://www.madeinmind.co.uk/) with Matthew Judkins to develop and commercialise the idea.

Fast forward a bit and Made In Mind has now unveiled [The Mu](https://www.themu.co.uk/), a USB power adapter built around the folding plug concept.

At £25 it's rather expensive, especially given that the mass-produced reality is slightly uglier and cheaper-looking than the original design, but all credit to them for bringing the product to market. Let's hope that it won't be long until they're producing[^fn-licencing] a folding plug to be used with other devices.

[^fn-alternatively]: If you've no time for video-watching then [this story](http://www.iconeye.com/news/rca-student-radically-improves-the-uk-plug) includes a good number of photos of the prototype.

[^fn-licencing]: Or licencing, perhaps? I'd love to see what Apple could do with MacBook adapters if they used this folding design. (Yes, yes, UK mains adapters are probably only required for a tiny percentage of all the MacBooks sold worldwide but let's be optimistic, remembering that the head of design at Apple is a Brit&#8230;)
