Do you remember Min-Kyu Choi&#8217;s folding plug design from a couple of years back?

No?! Shame on you. It was a phenomenal bit of work. Look, here&#8217;s his original [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6DvjKkGT6s) that went just a little bit viral. I&#8217;ll wait while you watch it. [embed width=&#8221;420&#8243; height=&#8221;315&#8243;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6DvjKkGT6s[/embed] 

(If you&#8217;ve no time for video-watching then [this story](http://www.iconeye.com/news/rca-student-radically-improves-the-uk-plug) includes a good number of photos of the prototype.)

Memory-refreshed? Right, well, after placing 3rd in the James Dyson Award 2009, taking a gold medal in the 2009  International Design Excellence Awards and winning Designs of the Year Product Award and Design of the Year at the Brit Insurance Design Awards 2010, Min-Kyu formed [Made In Mind](http://www.madeinmind.co.uk/) with Matthew Judkins to develop and commercialise the idea.

Fast forward a bit and Made In Mind has now unveiled [The Mu](https://www.themu.co.uk/), a USB power adapter built around the folding plug concept.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1642" title="The Mu" src="/images/fromwp/2012/03/themu.jpg" alt="The Mu" width="500" height="300" srcset="/images/fromwp/2012/03/themu.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2012/03/themu-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

At £25 it&#8217;s rather expensive, especially given that the mass-produced reality is slightly uglier and cheaper-looking than the original design, but all credit to them for bringing the product to market. Let&#8217;s hope that it won&#8217;t be long until they&#8217;re producing* a folding plug to be used with other devices.

* Or licencing, perhaps? I&#8217;d love to see what Apple could do with MacBook adapters if they used this folding design. (Yes, yes, UK mains adapters are probably only required for a tiny percentage of all the MacBooks sold worldwide but let&#8217;s be optimistic, remembering that the head of design at Apple is a Brit&#8230;)
