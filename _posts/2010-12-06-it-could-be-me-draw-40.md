And so i announce the results of the 40th draw in this 52 week experiment&#8230;

Numbers drawn: **04, 15, 19, 44, 45, 49** + bonus ball **11**

My Numbers: **06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44**

No. of matching numbers: **1 + bonus ball**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Nothing out of the ordinary there then. I expect there'll be another penny of interest in the bank account when i get around to checking. About the most exciting thing i have to report to you, dear viewer, is that i've finally changed my numbers. From next week onwards i'll be playing a Lucky Dip ticket (that's a ticket with a randomly generated set of six numbers, if you weren't aware of UK Lotto terminology). Which means you should probably go out before Saturday and buy yourself a ticket with 06, 09, 11, 23, 33, 44 selected.

**Lottery balance: £-40.00  //  Not A Lottery balance: £40.06**
