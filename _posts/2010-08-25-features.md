I've [written before](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/07/please-everybody-please-nobody/) about laptops sporting curious &#8220;dual pointing devices&#8221; designs. The [HP Elitebook 8540w](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/sm/WF25a/321957-321957-64295-4307559-4307559-4096175.html) is such a machine but the mouse isn't the bit that has prompted this post. No, for it has another, more bamboozling, _feature_.

The 8540w is a decent spec'd business laptop which is relatively good looking (at the side of the Toshiba Tecra M10-17H i covered before) and, as i said, sports the very odd trackpad _and_ nipple-in-keyboard mousing options&#8230;

But the part that immediately sparked my curiosity was this&#8230;

![HP Elitbook 8540W lamp!](/images/fromwp/2010/08/elitebook8540w_lamp.jpg)

Yes, that's a pop-out lamp! A little push-to-open, push-to-close LED lamp built into the monitor bezel. Oh, how i laughed. I laughed and laughed. And shook my head. And then laughed some more.

Why laugh at this novel approach to solving the problem of typing in the dark? Well, there are a few reasons. Firstly, the lamp is not centred over the keyboard that it is meant to light; it's positioned over to the right. Secondly, while the LED appears to be _SUPERBRIGHT_, there isn't a great deal of that candescence reaching the keyboard level &#8211; even in a pitch-black room. Finally, this solution looks more than a little clumsy, inelegant and backwards when compared with Apple's automatic backlit keyboards.
