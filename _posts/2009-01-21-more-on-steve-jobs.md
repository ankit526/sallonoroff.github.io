Every man and his dog are still reporting on Steve Jobs' health. On the whole it's just speculation or lazy copying of other people's speculation but I thought [this](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/488/1050488/steve-jobs-road-golgotha) was quite a sensible piece. While I don't really agree with the author's stance on Jobs' privacy, it is an interesting point of view.

Meanwhile, [Woz says](http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/index.cfm?newsid=24521) Jobs' time away &#8220;will probably be a great, great thing for Apple.&#8221;</a>

Also, really lazy journalists looking to write a piece on this subject may be grateful for [The Steve Jobs Health Story Template](http://macjournals.com/news/writeyourownjobsstory). It couldn't be simpler!
