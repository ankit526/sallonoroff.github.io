Every man and his dog are still reporting on Steve Jobs&#8217; health. On the whole it&#8217;s just speculation or lazy copying of other people&#8217;s speculation but I thought <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/488/1050488/steve-jobs-road-golgotha" target="_blank">this</a> was quite a sensible piece. While I don&#8217;t really agree with the author&#8217;s stance on Jobs&#8217; privacy, it is an interesting point of view.

Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/index.cfm?newsid=24521" target="_blank">Woz says Jobs&#8217; time away &#8220;will probably be a great, great thing for Apple.&#8221;</a>

Also, really lazy journalists looking to write a piece on this subject may be grateful for <a href="http://macjournals.com/news/writeyourownjobsstory" target="_blank">The Steve Jobs Health Story Template</a>. It couldn&#8217;t be simpler!
