You may recall that [my main gripe](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/06/on-the-joggler/) with O2&#8217;s Joggler is that for an internet-enabled device its functionality is too limited. There&#8217;s [talk](http://www.sallonoroff.co.uk/blog/2009/11/a-joggler-app-store/) of it soon having the now-obligatory &#8220;app store&#8221; but sadly for O2 they may have just been beaten to the punch by Sony, who [announced their &#8220;personal internet viewer&#8221; Dash](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2010/01/07/ces_sony_dash/) at [CES](http://www.cesweb.org/) yesterday.

This little box doesn&#8217;t look like it has a full web browser but with a reported 1000+ _free_ apps available at launch it covers a hell of a lot more content than the Joggler does. Of course, the Dash won&#8217;t do the SMS-integration and what-have-you offered by O2, but how many Jogglers are being bought for that stuff? I wouldn&#8217;t suspect that figure is very high.

If the Dash goes on sale in the UK with a reasonable price tag (it&#8217;s starting at $199 in the US &#8211;  fingers-crossed that means somewhere south of £150 over here) then it&#8217;ll certainly be more tempting than the Joggler ever was.
