My iPhoto library contains nearly 11,000 photos. I don&#8217;t sit looking through it, i rarely print out pictures and only very occasionally bother turning on the digital photo frame we have at home so i seldom actually see any of my photos. And nor does anyone else. Thinking about it, that&#8217;s a bit of a shame as i&#8217;m quite proud of some of the pictures i&#8217;ve taken. So i&#8217;ve put a (tiny) selection of my favourites online atÂ [http://sallonoroff.co.uk/photos](http://sallonoroff.co.uk/photos/).

**Update:** It&#8217;s 2 years later. I don&#8217;t think i added any pictures to that self-hosted collection, so i&#8217;ve deleted it. Instead, i&#8217;m now trying [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sallonoroff).
