A [thermochromatic urinal](http://www.neatorama.com/2011/05/03/thermochromatic-urinal/)! What a truly wonderful concept. I love it. I'm convinced that the Gents of your favoured drinking establishment would have a bone dry floor if they fitted one of these bad boys. It'd also be good for settling the argument of who can piss highest.
