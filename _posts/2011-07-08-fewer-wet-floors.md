A [thermochromatic urinal](http://www.neatorama.com/2011/05/03/thermochromatic-urinal/). What a truly wonderful concept. I love it. I&#8217;m convinced that the Gents of your favoured drinking establishment would have a bone dry floor if they fitted one of these bad boys. It&#8217;d also be good for settling the argument of who can piss highest.
