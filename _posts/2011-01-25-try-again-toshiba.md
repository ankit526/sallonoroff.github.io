They might&#8217;ve [failed with the Folio 100](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/11/15/dixons_drops_toshiba_tablet/) but Toshiba are back with another attempt on the iPad&#8217;s throne: Welcome [the Toshiba Tablet](http://thetoshibatablet.com/).

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/images/fromwp/2011/01/toshibatablet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1152" title="the toshiba tablet" src="/images/fromwp/2011/01/toshibatablet.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="315" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/01/toshibatablet.jpg 560w, /images/fromwp/2011/01/toshibatablet-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a>

Looking at the promo page, two things immediately strike me. 1) That is one CHUNKY tablet, and 2) Toshiba are really emphasising the technical specs of the device. That&#8217;s just the opposite of Apple&#8217;s iPad marketing which focuses almost exclusively on the software experience.

If you&#8217;re interested in seeing more pics of this beastie, you might prefer to look at the images on [The Register&#8217;s article](http://www.reghardware.com/2011/01/24/toshiba_tablet_teaser/) as the gallery on Toshiba&#8217;s site is very dark.

**PS.** It looks like someone&#8217;s dropped a bollock with Photoshop on that image i&#8217;ve used above. Can you spot the error?

(Clue: Look at the reflection beneath)
