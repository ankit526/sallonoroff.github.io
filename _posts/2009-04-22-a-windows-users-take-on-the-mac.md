[Here](http://www.thestandard.com/news/2009/04/16/windows-guru-spends-two-weeks-mac) is an overview of life with OSX by Preston Gralla, a Windows stalwart who has just spent two weeks using a MacBook Air rather than his normal PC(s). Certainly not the first but definitely one of the better articles i've read in this vain. It's a worthwhile read for PC users as it gives an unbiased and fair appraisal of the Mac. Mac-users should also give the article a skim to see how things you take for granted are actually a bit of a revelation to other people&#8230;
