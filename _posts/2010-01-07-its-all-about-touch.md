If this year's [CES](http://www.cesweb.org/) is anything to go by, it looks like the future of human-computer interaction is touch-based. Or is it just the threat of the eagerly-anticipated-yet-still-only-a-rumour Apple tablet that has everyone else scrambling to show off their best touch-based kit? Either way, just about everything that's piqued my interest in the CES coverage thus far has featured a touchscreen.

First up, Lenovo's IdeaPad U1 &#8211; a small[^fn-netbookeven] Windows7 laptop, with a detachable screen that is actually a standalone tablet[^fn-slateeven] device. Yes, when in &#8220;laptop&#8221; mode the thing sports a Core2Duo chip, 4GB RAM, HDMI output, etc but the detachable tablet section boasts its own Snapdragon ARM processor and 512MB RAM. A very neat idea. [More details at Electricpig](http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2010/01/06/lenovo-ideapad-u1-netbook-transforms-into-a-tablet/) and a there's [a vid of the kit of action over at Reg Hardware](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2010/01/07/ces_video_lenovo_hybrid_laptop/).

Next up, a netbook clad in brushed aluminium and sporting a touchscreen display &#8211; say hello to the HP Mini 5102&#8230;

More details and pictures [available at ElectricPig](http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2010/01/07/hp-mini-5102-touchscreen-netbook-revealed/).

And finally, I must of course mention [HP's &#8220;slate&#8221; prototype](http://gizmodo.com/5442200/hps-windows-7-slate-device-revealed-by-steve-ballmer) that Microsoft boss Steve Balmer showed to the CES crowd. It certainly looks great, has multi-touch input and will run Windows7 but that's all we know really. So that's all i can tell you. Literally, a mention. Clearly, [this &#8220;demo&#8221;](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/07/ballmer_demos_slates/) was Balmer's attempt at reminding the world that Apple aren't the only people working on shiny tablet devices.

[^fn-netbookeven]: It may even be classed as a netbook by some &#8211; though i reckon the spec is a bit too good for that label.

[^fn-slateeven]: Or slate, if you want to use the very, very latest buzzword.

**Update:** The ASUS NX90 laptop is probably worth a mention here also. It doesn't feature a touchscreen but it's the first machine i've seen with two trackpads &#8211; one on either side of the keyboard. Quite odd. Especially when there's a giant palm-rest area that's just begging to be used as a giant multi-touch surface. [Take a look at the pictures The Register has up](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2010/01/06/bando_asus_nx90/) of this Bang & Olufsen-styled laptop.
