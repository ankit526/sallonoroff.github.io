While i&#8217;m in a blogging mood and talking animation, let me share this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wY7KQmPYlo) with you. It&#8217;s a trailer for an upcoming Pixar short, The Blue Umbrella. While you&#8217;re watching this, please keep in mind that it is made completely inside a computer. No video footage of the real world here, only computer graphics. Just CG.

Just. Cee. Gee.

Simply incredible. There&#8217;s [a piece in the Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/01/07/watch-an-exclusive-clip-of-pixars-new-short-the-blue-umbrella/) about the short and its directorÂ Saschka Unseld if you want to know a bit more.
