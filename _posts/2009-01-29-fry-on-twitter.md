The very marvellous [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com) on Twittering in [a short clip by BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm). All a bit harried and unrehearsed - but what else could you expect when it looks like he has been acosted[^fn-acosted] by the journo outside Television Centre (presumably as he arrived for his appearance on Jonathan Ross' show last week).

Fry's twitterings can be found [here](http://twitter.com/stephenfry) if you're interested. And Jonathan Ross' tweets are [here](http://twitter.com/Wossy).

**Edit:** I've just noticed that Fry has updated [his blog with more views on Twitter](http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/).

[^fn-acosted]: Quite literally from the look of it.
