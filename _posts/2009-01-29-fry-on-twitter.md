The very marvellous <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com" target="_blank">Stephen Fry</a> on Twittering in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm" target="_blank">a short clip by BBC News</a>. All a bit harried and unrehearsed &#8211; but what else could you expect when it looks like he been acosted* by the journo outside Television Centre (presumably as he arrived for his appearance on Jonathan Ross&#8217; show last week).

Fry&#8217;s twitterings can be found [here](http://twitter.com/stephenfry) if you&#8217;re interested. And Jonathan Ross&#8217; tweets are [here](http://twitter.com/Wossy).

Edit: I&#8217;ve just noticed that Fry has updated [his blog with more views on Twitter](http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/).
