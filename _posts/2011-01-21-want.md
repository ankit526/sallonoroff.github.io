Thanks to (the ever-brilliant) [Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/quirkys_switch_a_user-configured_multi-tool_now_in_production_18313.asp), I've just discovered the [Quirky Switch](http://www.quirky.com/products/35-Switch-Modular-Pocket-Knife). It's a penknife (or &#8220;multi-tool&#8221;, if you prefer) that is user-configurable, allowing for between 4 and 13 tools to be fitted.

It's clever, gorgeous and i very much want one. Sadly at about £60 (and that's before HMRC add taxes onto the import) i don't think i can justify splashing out on one anytime soon.
