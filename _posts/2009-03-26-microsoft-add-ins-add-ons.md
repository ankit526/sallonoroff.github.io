When asked by a Windows-user how they can convert their work to a PDF, i usually respond with two possible solutions &#8211; [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) and [PDFcreator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/). If they're wanting to convert an MS Office document then they can open it in OpenOffice and use the built-in PDF-export feature to create a PDF. Alternatively, PDFcreator can be used from any program (that allows printing) since it appears as a printer and so allows you to &#8220;print out&#8221; PDF versions of your text, table, chart, image, etc.

I have, however, just discovered that Microsoft offer an &#8220;Add-in&#8221; for Office 2007 that eliminates the need any of the aboveÂ  if it is just Office documents you&#8217;re interested in converting. It's called &#8220;[Microsoft Save As PDF or XPS](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&displaylang=en)&#8221; and, surprise surprise, it simply adds a &#8220;Save as PDF&#8221; option to the menu in Word, Excel, Powerpoint, et al. Click that and the job's a good 'un.

Of course, my original suggestions are valid if you don't have MS Office 2007 (the add-in only appears to exist for that version) or you want to create PDFs from apps other than Office.

Finding this little tool reminded me of a few other &#8220;hidden&#8221; Microsoft add-ons and utilities i once discovered:

[PowerToys for Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx) &#8211; Loads of handy add-ons for XP, including slideshow generators, image resizer, calculator with unit conversion and access to extra interface settings.

[Network Diagnostics for Windows XP](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=914440) &#8211; A tool for troubleshooting (home) network connectivity issues.

[Microsoft USB Flash Drive Manager](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=94991901-BFC4-485E-BCAE-C9DF0ACCDAAE&displaylang=en) &#8211; Allows you to backup, manage and restore images of your USB flash/memory/thumb/pen drive(s).

[Windows Memory Diagnostics](http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp) &#8211; Create a bootable CD that&#8217;ll test your PC&#8217;s RAM for errors.

[Windows XP Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/window-on-windows/?p=42) &#8211; Allows you to mount ISO images as drives on your computer, so no need to burn the ISO to CD to access it. (official MS download [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe))

Why these useful tools aren't included in Windows to start with remains a mystery to me&#8230;
