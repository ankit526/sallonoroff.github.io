I do hope that you don&#8217;t rely on this blog in order to keep up-to-speed with &#8220;tech&#8221; news, as it&#8217;s been a long while since i posted about such things. There have been a few stories lately that i felt i could&#8217;ve written about but i just haven&#8217;t found time to (read: been bothered to), so here are the really short versions:

[**HP buys Palm**](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/28/hp-buys-palm/): I really, really, really, really, really hope that HP do something good with Palm&#8217;s webOS. Stick that mobile operating system inside a &#8220;the HP Slate&#8221; that Microsoft were showing off earlier in the year and the iPad might have a serious contender.

[**NewÂ Mac Mini**](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/15/apple_mac_mini/): Apple&#8217;s new Mac Mini is even mini-er, looks even more beautiful and adds HDMI output (What does this mean for the Apple TV?). BUT&#8230; SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY QUID! I remember when the Mini was Apple&#8217;s &#8220;budget&#8221; offering. That the machine doesn&#8217;t come with a keyboard and mouse now seems criminal.

[**iPhone 4 announced**](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/07/apple-announces-iphone-4-with-retina-display-hd-video-recording-more/): The marketing proclaims this is a revolution. Hyperbole, of course. It is a very nice evolution of the platform though. I&#8217;ve resisted 3 incarnations but i&#8217;ll definitely be buying this one.

[**Slim XBOX360**](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/14/xbox_and_kinect/) **and** [**Project Natal = Kinect**](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/14/microsoft_xbox_natal_kinect/): Microsoft&#8217;s XBOX360 has been shrunk slightly, got a shiny new angular-design case, comes with WiFi built-in, a 250GB hard drive and is &#8220;whisper quiet&#8221;. No word on whether this new box is any more reliable than the old ones though (We&#8217;ll assume not &#8211; though note the new Slim 360 is [incapable of showing the Red Ring of Death](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/16/new-xbox-360-loses-ability-to-flash-a-red-ring-can-still-probab/)). Microsoft&#8217;s other announcement was that the Wii-a-like Project Natal will come to market as &#8220;Kinect&#8221;. So soon you&#8217;ll be able to dance about in front of the telly if you like. Personally, i associate gaming with sitting on my fat arse, expending as little energy as possible.
