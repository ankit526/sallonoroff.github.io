I do hope that you don't rely on this blog in order to keep up-to-speed with &#8220;tech&#8221; news, as it's been a long while since i posted about such things. There have been a few stories lately that i felt i could've written about but i just haven't found time to (read: been bothered to), so here are the really short versions:

[HP buys Palm](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/28/hp-buys-palm/): I really, really, really, really, really hope that HP do something good with Palm's webOS. Stick that mobile operating system inside &#8220;the HP Slate&#8221; that Microsoft were showing off earlier in the year and the iPad might have a serious contender.

[NewÂ Mac Mini](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/15/apple_mac_mini/): Apple's new Mac Mini is even mini-er, looks even more beautiful and adds HDMI output[^fn-whattv]. BUT&#8230; SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY QUID! I remember when the Mini was Apple's &#8220;budget&#8221; offering. That the machine doesn't come with a keyboard and mouse now seems criminal.

[iPhone 4 announced](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/07/apple-announces-iphone-4-with-retina-display-hd-video-recording-more/): The marketing proclaims this is a revolution. Hyperbole, of course. It is a very nice evolution of the platform though. I've resisted 3 incarnations but i'll definitely be buying this one.

[Slim XBOX360](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/14/xbox_and_kinect/) and [Project Natal = Kinect](http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/14/microsoft_xbox_natal_kinect/): Microsoft's XBOX360 has been shrunk slightly, got a shiny new angular-design case, comes with WiFi built-in, a 250GB hard drive and is &#8220;whisper quiet&#8221;. No word on whether this new box is any more reliable than the old ones though[^fn-probablynot]. Microsoft's other announcement was that the Wii-a-like Project Natal will come to market as &#8220;Kinect&#8221;. So soon you'll be able to dance about in front of the telly if you like. Personally, i associate gaming with sitting on my fat arse, expending as little energy as possible.

[^fn-whattv]: What does this mean for the Apple TV?

[^fn-probablynot]: We'll assume not &#8211; though note the new Slim 360 is actually [incapable of showing the Red Ring of Death](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/16/new-xbox-360-loses-ability-to-flash-a-red-ring-can-still-probab/).
