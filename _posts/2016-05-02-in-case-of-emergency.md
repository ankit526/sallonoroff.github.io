Remember in the olden days when you used to stick &#8220;ICE&#8221; onto names in your phone&#8217;s addressbook to denote an emergency contact? I&#8217;ve no clue if the emergency services ever made use of that information, but it was a well-meaning idea that took hold at some point*. Certainly, my wife still has me down as &#8220;ICE Mark&#8221; in her mobile. Only, in the age of smartphones, that&#8217;s no use now is it? She has an iPhone that (correctly) will more than likely be locked should she not be in a position to provide emergency contact details herself.

Clearly the ICE system needs revising for the modern, secure mobile. Fortunately, Apple&#8217;s iOS already has a solution to this: [Medical ID](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203037#medicalid).

[Introduced in 2014 with the Health app in iOS 8](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8321/the-ios-8-review/7), Medical ID allows the iPhone owner&#8217;s medical information &#8211; including emergency contact details &#8211; to be displayed on an otherwise locked device with just a few taps. Perfect.

I won&#8217;t bother repeating [the details of how to set it up when good guides already exist](http://512pixels.net/2014/09/how-to-setup-medical-id-with-ios-8s-health-app/), just make sure you take 5 minutes to follow those instructions. And then spread the word. After all, if you didn&#8217;t know about Medical ID, chances are your friends and family don&#8217;t either.
