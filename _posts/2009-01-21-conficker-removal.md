Windows Users &#8211; If you're worried that you may have contracted [the Conficker (AKA Downadup) worm](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/15/conficker_worm/) (like Sheffield's Hospitals [apparently have](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/20/sheffield_conficker/)), the good people at F-Secure have [released a removal tool](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001588.html) that may be of some use to you.
