Just taking a moment to signpost David Chartier&#8217;s excellent site, [Finer Things in Tech](http://finerthings.in). It&#8217;s a great resource, highlighting some of the neat little details that you might have overlooked in software you use every day.

My mentioning this now has, of course, absolutely nothing to do with me recently sharing [a little discovery about iOS&#8217; Touch ID](http://finerthings.in/ios/touch-id-settings-can-identify-which-fingers-you-enabled/) on the site.
