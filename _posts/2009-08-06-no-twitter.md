[Twitter](http://twitter.com/) has been unavailable for most of this afternoon. [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/06/twitter_outage/) and [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8188201.stm) are reporting it's because of a DoS attack. At times like these i wonder how much more strain the site in question is put under simply by the genuine users repeatedly refreshing the page to see if it's back online. I know i'm guilty of doing that today.
