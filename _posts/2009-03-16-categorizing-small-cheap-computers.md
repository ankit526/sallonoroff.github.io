Do you have trouble distinguishing an ultra-portable from a sub-notebook? Can't spot a netbook in a sea of ULPCs? Well, [El Reg has compiled a lovely little flowchart](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/miniature_computer_field_guide/) for helping you categorize those Small, Cheap Computers.

Shame it doesn't help with the conundrum of the difference between a notebook and a laptop&#8230;
