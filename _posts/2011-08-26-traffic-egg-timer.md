A very [novel concept from Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com/2010/11/18/sands-of-traffic-times/) for updating the humble traffic light&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1382" title="Yanko Design's Sand Glass Signal" src="/images/fromwp/2011/08/sandglasssignal.jpg" alt="Yanko Design's Sand Glass Signal" width="500" height="331" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/08/sandglasssignal.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2011/08/sandglasssignal-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

It&#8217;s slightly flawed, as no thought appears to have been given to making a distinction between amber-turning-to-red and amber-turning-to-green (as far as i can tell), but i&#8217;m sure that could easily be overcome. This idea really tickled me.
