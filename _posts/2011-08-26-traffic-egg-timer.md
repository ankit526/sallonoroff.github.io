A very [novel concept from Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com/2010/11/18/sands-of-traffic-times/) for updating the humble traffic light&#8230;

It's slightly flawed, as no thought appears to have been given to making a distinction between amber-turning-to-red and amber-turning-to-green (as far as i can tell), but i'm sure that could easily be overcome. This idea really tickled me.
