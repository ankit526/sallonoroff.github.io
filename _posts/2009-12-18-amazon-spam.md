Lately I've been getting a lot more Amazon email &#8220;newsletters&#8221; than i used to. I was considering writing something here about this annoyance&#8230; but [Andrew Taylor beat me to it](http://www.apathysketchpad.com/blog/2009/12/15/essentially-i-am-now-being-stalked-by-a-shop/). His post is much better than the half-witted grumble mine would've been.
