Readers of a certain age and with a penchant for novel home decoration may be excited to discover that such a thing as this exists&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1341" title="arcade light switch" src="/images/fromwp/2011/07/arcadelightswitch.jpg" alt="arcade light switch" width="500" height="332" srcset="/images/fromwp/2011/07/arcadelightswitch.jpg 500w, /images/fromwp/2011/07/arcadelightswitch-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />

Yep, that&#8217;s right, [you can now buy](http://www.etsy.com/listing/74059377/working-arcade-light-switch) a lightswitch that uses classic arcade machine buttons to turn your lights on and off. A sure fire way to ensure your bulbs are blown in a matter of hours.
