So, am i a millionaire yet? Am i bollocks.

Numbers drawn: **23, 25, 28, 33, 44, 49** + bonus ball **46**

My Numbers: **6, 9, 16, 23, 27, 32**

No. of matching numbers: **1**

Price of ticket: **£1**

Amount won: **£0**

Financial outcome: **-£1**

Meanwhile, my online savings account is now home to _two_ pound coins.

All of which means that the non-lottery option continues to prove the better option...
